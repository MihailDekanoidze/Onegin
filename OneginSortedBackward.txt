And dined with her d�shabill�.
ONEGIN'S LETTER TO TATYANA
The children learn their ABC.
The sacred letters, O and E.
THE GIRLS' SONG
To pair Yevgeny and I,
And so in careless rapture I
My friends, in bending: 'It is I!'
TATYANA'S LETTER TO ONEGIN
Must take this letter, secretly, to O...
And then he'll dress, may write a letter, a
Though Racine, or Seneca
'You're married then! I'd no idea!
To fight the waves, and scour the sea,
But by breakfast, dinner, tea;
And Dunya sits to pour the tea,
Calls her welcome from the sofa;
'Why did you leave so early,' Olga
Poor Lenksy! Not for long did Olga
'And then what became of Olga?
Turning his troubled gaze on Olga
Sometimes he read to Olga,
O, the country! O, Russia!
To mourn there for gloomy Russia,
Enthral like Martin Zadeka,
Friends of Ruslan and Ludmila,
Your three thousand year diploma!
Where no face showed of Diana
Substituting - belle Tatiana!
While Zhukovsky's Svetlana
Sad as Zhukovsky's Svetlana,
Thou, my Svetlana.
Haunted by love's pain, Tatyana,
So, she is called Tatyana.
Can this really be Tatyana,
The girls are stowed with Tatyana,
'And this is my own Tatyana.' -
Tatyana, my dear Tatyana!
Seemed as one to poor Tatyana...
They sit across from our Tatyana,
'And tell me, which was Tatyana?'
That with sheer beauty charms Tatyana
But she takes fright, my Tatyana,
Her sister's name was...Tatyana,
Boldly replacing its belle Nina,
Long ago, Princess Alina,
'Princess, mon ange' - 'Pachette!' - 'Alina!'
Such I adore, my dear Elvina,
Along with Cottin's work Malvina,
With Aunt Pelageya Nikolevna
The nurse, old Filipevna,
A liar yet, Lubov Petrovna;
Powder-white Lukerya Lvovna;
Grandmamma and grandpapa
They say in turn's the nearest spa.
Boos Cleopatra, hisses Phaedra,
Second stroll, and then et cetera...
And captive girls by the Salgira,
Reader, I'll enhance the vista,
Softly humming: Benedetta
The sky aglow above the Neva,
The Cleopatra of the Neva,
Of our proud imperial Neva.
Yet you'll agree I hope, that diva,
Off, in haste, with Pustyakova;
Lensky, Tanya's; Kharlikova,
Shared wild applause, with Semyonova,
Beside fair Nina Voronskaya,
Alone and sad, my darling Tanya,
To gaze on, of the former Tanya;
Quite rarefied, review my Tanya,
Then how did you come to wed?' 'Tanya,
It was God's will now, my Vanya,
Departs the room, yet asks Anisya
Pushes its grandsires to the tomb.
The world to him both sealed and dumb? ...
In my thoughts, I was struck dumb.
With fond indulgence; witty, tragic,
Deep in all things economic
The wealth of nations was his topic;
All of that ancient rhetoric,
Better than one dour modern lyric?' -
The wretched wreath of elegy (sic),
Waves of the distant Adriatic,
When inspired again, ecstatic,
Read Fontenelle. He was eclectic,
But hush! You hear? Our sternest critic
Though I fail to see what's romantic
Read Bayle, as well, the arch-sceptic;
The casual, the idealistic,
Inconsequential dreams; the arc
Saw nothing good, predicted bad,
But as it is, our roads are bad;
Doctors, and weeping women, dead!
Find life a ritual, dull and dead,
Its drum pounds fit to wake the dead.
And full of grief that he was dead,
Where to? God knows. The trail is dead.
Such things belong to youth, now dead.
With tumult in his heart and head,
But still found nothing in his head,
On her shoulder leans his head;
The Prince, amused, turns his head,
At last near dawn, his weary head
The formal dinners stretch ahead,
His wedding two scant weeks ahead.
The love-god, Lel, overhead
Spirals upwards, overhead;
The winged god hovers overhead.
Great shelves of books he read and read
To whom the first few lines were read...
In his deft satire: Is all you've read
Which Olga never would have read.
Novel that you choose to read,
What? Invitations? Swiftly read,
The golden coals, a slender thread
With a Persian fabric spread,
The sensual touch, on rugs to tread
In attic too. Eugene, instead,
She turns them all down, instead
Kind and sober, now, instead,
You left no trace, but loved instead
Nodding, he laid it down instead
Over the darkened stones instead,
Enough. It's high time that instead,
Gave himself to it instead,
In every sorrow that she had,
And draw to us a handsome lad,
Was not enamoured, thought him mad
The fleas at halts drive you mad,
- 'At the Larins.' - 'How very odd.
The secrets of the marriage bed,
The pile of books, then the bed
Midst swarms of children, lie in bed,
At last he stirs, sits up in bed
Drives home, preferring his own bed.
Tatyana takes herself to bed,
He flees the ball, and finds his bed,
Vision, standing by my bed,
So, often, while he's still abed,
When all of Petersburg's abed,
In confusion, thoughts perturbed.
Asks him, 'yesterday? Disturbed,
As a veteran, solemn faced,
A cherub, motionless, red-faced,
Quite dumb, because so tightly-laced;
Considering himself, so placed,
Yawning the while as he raced,
All the neighbours were seduced.
At the Larins had produced
No, for his early feelings faded,
The brief acquaintances were ended.
They took offence, and once offended
The manor house was quite secluded,
Only a strange sad pallor clouded
The sky with autumn's breath is clouded,
More often now the sun is shrouded;
Screened by the hills when storms intruded,
Kissed, and fussed about, and crowded
He almost lost his mind, indeed,
It's for Onegin.' - 'Yes, indeed,
A charming portrait, yes, indeed,
That here was wit and charm indeed.
Not exactly what we need!
Child, is there something you need?'
Fashionable rings they need.
For all of that monotonous breed
That's sired by boredom out of greed.
What more is needed? All agreed
Some claimed the marriage was agreed,
Fresh hope on which my heart is fed?
And yet my Onegin's etched.
And she, whose lines I sketched
At Whitsuntide, their tears they'd shed
'Where, oh where have you vanished,
By chance, I have the lines, unfinished,
Rise and ripen, briefly nourished,
Wed, the fire would soon have died;
And hurriedly, before it died,
His nag: it's ill, it nearly died.
Has never with letters been allied.
And then, if suddenly she spied
With Lensky's fate pre-occupied;
The next room too; unoccupied,
Instead we see, her sash untied,
Bullets are loaded, weapons cocked,
Pistols gleam, hammers are knocked
And cloistered life Onegin led.
The huntsman by the hedge, concealed.
He who had never once concealed
The letter's done, is folded, sealed...
Tatyana! Whose name is revealed?
And he then rapidly skedaddled,
But as, at the back porch, was saddled
The lady of the manse has fled.
All memory of him swiftly fled
Or force them to be reconciled,
Her mother's scarcely reconciled:
Though privately they'd be reviled,
She samples them, and as if called
To an unknown world's enthralled.
A needle, never once excelled,
Words echoing there: Well and Killed.
Hears, and then his heart is chilled,
Who to his grave the poet hurled?
Prematurely blighted, doomed!
Killed before his promise bloomed,
The spring revived him. He hastened
So Eugene preached, as she listened;
Saw nothing through the tears that glistened,
Or on a page some other's signed,
In working something she'd designed.
A soul for passion's fires designed,
A caricature he next designed
Her nod as quiet and restrained.
Her manner is as self-contained,
The lengthy silence ends, refined
Alone, to Lensky's taste inclined.
Her head above the silk inclined,
And Tanya alone, in secret, pined;
Where the roots are intertwined
The dance to Olga, as he'd planned;
Is here at last, the journey planned,
The stately pile was nobly planned
The fruit of carefree hours, unplanned,
For Boston, claiming the old-fashioned,
In matters of duelling reckoned
Those keenest to take part are summoned,
Speak the reproach I have earned!
I await you: one look turned
On the flowers, their eyes quite red,
Is speaking? See, she's wearing red.'
And spoke as if he scarcely cared,
Now free, my verse no longer feared
Nor went mad, or died, as feared.
Love faded then the Muse appeared,
The winter snows soon disappeared.
What might result: 'Ever prepared.'
In his twenties, a dandy bred,
His stallion, a Don thoroughbred,
Penned by Lensky, and as he offered
The visit, a note he proffered,
Where I've loved, where I've suffered,
Nature waited, icy-fingered
That year, the autumn lingered,
When to the flag we have gathered
Where my heart has long been smothered.
When passions' flames have wavered,
With purer inspiration fired,
So Yazykov, when you're inspired
Prince Vyazemsky, Muse-inspired,
The noble elegies you've sired,
Once calling on an aunt, the bored
In the end he too grew bored
And an old man whom she'd ignored
Over a game of chess they pored,
Their steaming cups, have barely stirred,
To ease the pain his love incurred.
That washed its face, and purred,
When but a boy his heart was captured,
By Olga, and as one enraptured
She brought her glories, never ceased
Closes the tale, before it's ceased,
Eugene Onegin, born and raised
Beat the servant girls and cursed,
Curbs the flames with which I'm cursed.
A London dandy safely classed
That they by Mother Earth are blessed!
Perhaps her nurse, if she'd been blessed,
And by Heaven has been blessed,
In our regard, has left us blessed
By winter her mute heart's oppressed.
By melancholy tears oppressed,
By a single thought oppressed:
With quicker wits, might have guessed.
Their love, their hatred, went un-missed.
How poisonous the words he used!
What traps he set for those abused!
Buyanov's asked her: she refused.
That Hussar, Pykhtin, she confused,
At ill-bred men he deprecated,
Surveyed it, and pontificated.
Killed the flies, and rusticated,
At dinner, when intoxicated.
The old ones utterly out-dated,
They cross themselves, grace is repeated,
Like that by Delvig's muse created,
Perhaps for glory he was created,
For conversation's art created.
From every pleasure he retreated,
Then a buzz, while all are seated.
The jagged flints once firmly seated,
Perhaps that lyre, to silence fated,
To what their mistresses were fated,
At every single thing he hated,
He was no fool; appreciated
Flattered her, smiled, ingratiated
Lensky is overjoyed, elated,
And her youthful charms, elated,
As well-read, but opinionated,
But for his wit, which he rated,
Epiphany they celebrated,
To whom our hearts were consecrated,
For forty years had berated
Fault was charming, though it grated?
By Fyodor Tolstoy, decorated
You handsome albums, illustrated
The new ones simply antiquated,
He was quite infatuated,
So, Vladimir more captivated
As servants of the Muse have acted,
All evening Lensky was distracted,
They find her strange, somewhat affected,
As a girl's thoughts, unaffected,
He sang of love, to love subjected,
To his Tatyana, though rejected,
Tatyana such things rejected;
He undresses; a book's selected,
And when nurse had collected
Though you're a spouse respected,
At home, his pistols are inspected
Reader, you've guessed, as I suspected,
Unfashionable, but that's expected,
Yet the most loyal, it's expected,
Are raised again, the work's completed.
You must go, they'd be delighted.
Resolute, impatient, waited,
Love's sweet crown so long awaited,
When suddenly they're visited,
At first the neighbours visited,
Besides, my friend, you're invited,
Alas, poor Yorick!' he lamented,
'In his arms I played, contented,
Within, a rural landscape painted,
One with which she's acquainted,
That your pencils were all blunted,
Here too was Prolasov, so stunted
The old mother, broken-hearted,
Not long before, tender-hearted,
Opponents! They'd not long been parted
Wept for her daughter; as they parted
You too Yevgeny quite deserted.
The Muse he might well have deserted,
Settled, to married life converted,
With all their weary weight allotted.
These hours that fate has plotted,
Always unjustly persecuted,
His character was executed
But often to the window glued
In kindred souls too he believed,
Who longing to unite them, grieved
Over my urn, and think: "He loved,
The simple girlish way she loved.
By me alone his soul was moved!"...?
Onegin's heart was deeply moved;
Washing, with fresh snow, removed
But Tanya's spirit is unmoved,
For teeth or nails, both are served,
And at the table, dinner served,
Due rank and custom they observed.
Scissors with straight blades and curved.
He hoped Olga and I would wed,
His darling to another wed;
'Olga's younger, yet she's wed,
Sighing: 'It's high time she was wed!'...
His thirties, profitably wed,
To bear on things we've all eschewed,
In time (who knows?) I might have viewed
Father of many, still unwed;
As in the olden days they flowed,
There such freedoms are allowed,
'Is he the same, or has he mellowed?
Is it the same plan he once followed,
And here is autumn golden-browed,
Unhappy with the role he'd played.
He watched her as she sang and played.
Where the pensive dryads played.
As an air from Weber's Freisch�tz played,
In masculine attire displayed
It's been willingly displayed.
Yet left Eugene, alone, dismayed,
Olga he thought would be dismayed;
Over the girl, and trembling prayed.
On the far heights, where he strayed,
A meaning that her heart obeyed.
By nervous hands, mind half-obeyed.
Into the dark may have conveyed
His tender look still conveyed
My lively Muse and I enjoyed
The only law that I employed;
A roaring in her ears, eyes dazed...
The breath on her lips is glazed,
Found your fame, perhaps amazed,
Fine verses on his Finnish Maid.
The corpse on a table laid,
Beside the fire a table's laid,
The place where my poor nurse was laid
But enough, enough: you've paid
Nature's debt already paid.
For timber and tallow, quickly paid,
For my Zaretsky, as I said,
Some are no more, as Saadi said.
Remember what Dimitriev said
You mothers, hear me too, I bid,
Or else.....or else, may God forbid!
Recalling all the good he did,
And knew by heart, or thought he did,
Two whole lines of the Aeneid.
As pure as winter's ice, as rigid,
As stern, as distant, and as frigid.
Though silent on the bad he hid.
His vein then was dark and languid,
Her tender fingers never held
With vineyard, water, wood, and field,
Glimpsing from the distant field
'What's to be done? She's not a child.'
Then Monsieur taught the child
Failed to join the shameless guild,
A pleasant-natured lad but wild.
Of rumours, threats: prophetic, old;
'My darling, well, I'm getting old;
Unfathomable, even to the bold,
Yet his life grew sad and cold.
Two slender feet...Now sad and cold
I've known women, proud and cold,
In the sound, and silence cold,
Yet he arrived, his uncle cold,
The echo of midwinter's cold!
Once master had no need to scold,
Christmas comes, joys unfold,
Prepared, for the sake of gold,
No need to keep reserves of gold.
Like yours my darling, made to hold,
Alas! Her look seems to hold
On what the state relies, he told,
To blow his brains out, as we're told,
The fortunes of the young are told;
In mysterious legends that told
And that fugitive from the world,
And be as happy...as I could!
Call Praskovya, Pauline, and would
Both the sisters, by the hand,
But Fate took Eugene by the hand
And putting out a trembling hand
That's not the business we've in hand,
My rhyming novel's well in hand,
The letter trembles in her hand;
These varied chapters in your hand,
Each with a pistol in his hand,
Motionless and nerveless hand,
As if a cold, an icy hand
Firmly founded on the land,
He left his village and his land,
Lets him draw her to dry land,
But where, in what deserted strand
Since with a cab hired from the stand,
The fields, the woods, that silent stand,
Opposite his friend must stand.
Ah, little feet where do you stand?
Re-upholstered, there they stand,
First Madame, you understand,
And jealousy, you understand,
To our measure, in the end?
The Prince presents him, in the end:
Invite her home, too, in the end,
All make for home in the end,
Bored with leisure in the end,
Come to me, come: yours, to the end!...'
Always faithful to the end,
Awaits us all, at the end,
The poet is no more...the end
I tremble to re-read....must end!
Who met with an untimely end,
Where Italy's gold nights descend,
Like Venus if she'd condescend
I beg you, go: and you'll defend
With your self-image? He may offend
The passer-by can read the legend
Her failure too to comprehend;
But you, Bordeaux, are a friend
Voice of lover, foe and friend,
The indulgence of a childhood friend;
A fatal wound on some young friend,
Friend of my heart, eternal friend,
The murderer of their dear friend;
Squeeze her hand, kiss their friend,
His story) having killed his friend,
To know its beauty, be its friend.
In the album of some sweet friend,
'Ah, boredom, that's what's bad, my friend.'
I was their neighbour.' 'Come, my friend...'
I read to my old nurse, who'll lend
Her sing-song voice in gossip blend,
On whom alone shall we depend?
On you alone I must depend
A full three hours at least he'd spend
I love you (why should I pretend?)
Attention to her album: find,
Are enchanting, friends, I find!
In life's fresh glow, he still could find
Am I unworthy, you would find.
I can't see it. Here's what you'll find
Was this what you hoped to find;
And yet I was amazed to find
While fated everywhere to find,
To leave a name for fate to find,
Of pure respect, followed behind,
Leaving not a trace behind.
He leaves a tender verse behind,
Of things none dare leave behind;
She dare not stop, or look behind,
The world; the ball, are left behind,
Ah well, to them may God be kind!
Pots and basins, jugs; the kind
And your reproach repay in kind.
Adding to albums of that kind,
Dispel my doubts, I am blind,
Be so enslaved, so cruel, so blind?'
There's no escape, in her sad mind,
Enchantment, with an unspoiled mind.
Can you, with such a heart and mind,
Them often feign a change of mind,
The fancies of a foolish mind,
Chest puffed out, content in mind.
Another day I bring to mind!
What passes now through her mind?
Them both, but no one knew her mind,
Our face will never cross their mind...
Your true seducer in your mind.
May be construed by your mind
Not such as to engage his mind.
Of every guest there, in his mind.
That Olga occupies his mind,
With your pure and ardent mind;
I must confess I scarcely mind
A fiery will, a lively mind,
A General's, noble, to my mind.
Far more enchanting, to my mind.
All such is alien to my mind;
Hospitable, a family grind,
Of two tall pines; where waters wind
Zaretsky asked, 'is your second?'
But you, the suspect volumes bound,
By our heroine sits, spell-bound.
Tatyana lingers: she's spell-bound.
Onegin searched the cupboards, found
A role as husband, father; found
And waking early, Tanya found,
Where he's no longer to be found,
Although inseparable I've found
Funds for a Moscow winter found.
Of criticism, most profound,
Ready to praise us or to hound,
My life with the domestic round;
Stiffening, as his friends stand round,
She recovers, gazes round,
Blows chill; the sleeping groves, around
While they chew. All around,
And not the least ink-stain around,
A whiteness covering the ground:
To watch him lying on the ground,
His weapon spirals to the ground.
Leaving his tea and rum aground,
In secret regions underground,
Advice both sensible and sound.
Strikes for the poet, at the sound,
Diverted by the welcome sound,
With the glasses' clinking sound.
Why not? It has a pleasant sound,
Though sad echoes still resound.
Behind a door cheers resound,
Aren't you bored to death, dear God,
Token of every beauty, good,
A pure devotion to the good
Alone, alone it seemed for good!
Commands us to reject for good,
To our poetic brotherhood,
Time was when she would write, in blood,
From the start, had fired his blood.
You fill my soul, and my blood!
And for a long while Tanya stood
Or to whom we send a card,
Tanya downcast, as if she heard,
Thus, you never would have heard
Flute, bassoon, are gladly heard.
At least, denoting our regard,
Deep in thought, above the board,
And recreate the magic hoard,
He saunters on the Boulevard,
Now, for the first time, I reward
Is sleeping soundly: in the yard,
He sends a second and a third,
And jealously the world afford
His seat at the clavichord,
With parting, vengeance with a word,
Subtle, acute, and, in a word,
At some soire where...not a word,
Of guests arriving brought the word,
Of shame or misery, one word.
Too often by a foreign word,
Here is his letter, word for word.
Eugene had found, with what word
A dark reproach in every word.
The classic mask, the trumpet, sword,
With duelling, pistols, and the sword.
All that we now find absurd.
He'd agreed, what found absurd.
My style is rendered quite absurd
Finding all jealousy absurd -
The crush intense, the noise is loud.
Now! Now! With joy, I call aloud,
Do you now voice your thoughts aloud?
And now the north wind drives the cloud,
The dawning day in sombre cloud.
Signal each passing sail, each shroud.
As a storm will often shroud
As much as in Moscow, the proud.
Enough of praise though for the proud,
A mazurka holds the crowd;
For whom among that jealous crowd,
My songs inspired by that crowd.
Three houses offer a soir�e:
Those with other meaning. He
As at the feast he seemed to be?
As such fine mansions ought to be,
This fortune-telling, I'll let be.
What's this he's hearing? Can it be...?
Reader, whoever you may be,
Could kindly fate for me prescribe
'Could I happily circumscribe
Of rationality and peace,
'Farewell now, you haunts of peace,
Is to aim at his pallid face
Pretty yes, with that round face,
Makes his way, with corpselike face,
One has a horned and doglike face;
A sensitive and handsome face.
From that dark forbidding face;
And as a rule despised each face,
With some fair Venetian face,
Noting the pallor in her face.
In all her person, form or face,
Eugene, I first saw your face;
Red as a poppy, your bright face.'
Breath of spring caress my face,
The setting for a pretty face.' -
As you leave the village, a place
Now like some deserted place,
In his songs kept pride of place,
In some peaceful rural place!
The green card-tables are in place,
To ready himself, have all in place,
A skeleton haughtily in place;
At the table takes her place,
Would condemn me in that place,
Moscow's a better market-place!
Then rattle on at lightening pace.
She quickens her despairing pace,
That inspired soul knew, a space
So far away in time and space,
As the foolish moon in space,
Across a gentlemanly space,
With shadows all its gloomy space,
Into the lobby's empty space,
And for you, knowledgeable race,
Holy friends of the human race
Though he knew the human race,
Powdery furrows as they race,
The two old women weep, embrace,
Float in a gondola's embrace,
Immortals clasped in fate's embrace,
To show intelligence and grace,
Nonchalantly, full of grace,
Or whist, that's never out of grace,
Tanya replied to each with grace;
And therefore my fall from grace
He never managed to disgrace,
Horace
Yet she'd not a single trace
I see your fretting's left no trace,
The swift kibitkas' runners trace
Extends, and tries the gleaming ice,
Two slender boughs glued by ice,
Our minds are full of prejudice,
There a minister, out of office,
Lensky's luckless sacrifice...
To the hostess they raise the chalice
Un-blighted by the world's cold malice,
Talk seasoned with the salt of malice;
Idols replaced you, a worse choice?
Back to his regiment, her choice
Oh Brenta! No: yet I'll rejoice
To make the soul of man rejoice,
Listen now to my sad voice.
And soon our Olga's chiming voice
The power of some life-giving voice
I hear the magic of your voice!
His memoirs to an empty coppice,
All that, to sate boundless caprice,
And of his every caprice,
And in the bath-house, in a trice
Let's surround him, in a trice,
Slithers, and slips, in a trice,
Taking her nurse's fond advice,
To make a passer-by think twice:
The colonel's sent them, so, a dance!
Mazurka, gallop, waltz...they dance.
I marvelled at their arrogance,
When we met, long ago, by chance,
Lightly at the lines, by chance,
His living tears obscured his glance;
Yet revealing in his glance,
Lifting the gauzy veil may glance
Iron virtue, chilly glance,
No pride, and no chilly glance,
Meet my hero of romance,
Of roses in some high romance;
For that fatal sustenance,
Listening with tolerance,
The young girls dream, in a trance,
Relinquished his inheritance,
I've not the strength for repentance,
Content with life, took a stance,
Summons the servant for assistance;
Fired by longing, circumstance,
I dared not trust the circumstance,
No pretension in her advance,
Before you, let him now advance.
How languid was his reticence,
Filled with grace and innocence,
And daze the eyes of innocence,
Of shy provincial innocence,
That breathes a young girl's innocence.
Present the clearest evidence
Stables, kitchens, and a fence.
Go seeking quarrels, take offence,
Though innocent tries one's patience.
Sounds more sweetly in the silence,
Then he bowed to her, in silence,
I cede my own in deference.....
Among sad cliffs for preference.
Though, in her indifference,
Onegin's unexpected presence;
How many follies in its presence,
Captivated by its essence;
All's tedium, madness, and pretence
In an instant, with this pretence,
French still entrances in a sentence,
Then, at Zaretsky's insistence,
The talk turns with quiet persistence
To a bachelor's sad existence,
I was born for quiet existence
Humbly living out existence,
My being in family existence
How passionate his eloquence,
Still the throbbing is fierce,
Sees he is loved, feels the force
'Well?' says Zaretsky, with force.
Her love thus, since, despite its force,
The cue's abandoned, half-lights fade,
She wanders, purposeless, a shade,
Where the mute and blood-stained shade
Found his place, or, martyred shade,
To rest, beneath the woodland shade.'
Filled with sweet passion, pensive shade,
Deepening the garden's shade,
Or the lime-tree alley's shade,
Never having felt love's blade,
Backward, I glance. Farewell the glade,
For a few books, a garden glade,
No solace in the silent glade:
Of Lensky haunted every glade;
At the unexpected move he'd made,
The sign of the cross she made
Where he his visitation made.
The tribute that to folly's made.
Nor Baratynsky, who has made
We sing those who, fortunes made,
Here's the first use of it made
Thoughts of fleas and lemonade;
Shovelling silver with a spade,
The noise, the glare, the masquerade,
To enter on the masquerade.
Sends us through the Baltic trade,
And in a sing-song voice confide,
Her secret wish to it confide.
Hovers, still these girls will hide
Then, the year through, we can hide,
Some girlish secret that they hide.
Then proud ladies, see her glide,
A block of snow will slowly glide,
Then gather momentum in its slide.
So: Madame Larina, while we ride,
Brooding silently, she'll ride,
Like pale Lenore, in moonlit ride,
Our great language, in its pride,
My flighty mistress and my pride,
The bearded outrider's astride
To lead her to the other side;
Of my verse by the water's side
The crescent moon, at her left side,
The Muse was ever at my side.
Galloping onwards at my side!
And, seated quietly by my side,
Beside a river. On every side,
Or else (all joking aside)
'Could I, perhaps, just see inside?'
While both indoors and outside
Oh, this stupid countryside!
Visits to at Christmas-tide,
The lads run to find a guide:
Believe me (conscience is my guide)
She sorrows at the dark divide;
Lanterns glitter far and wide,
Stretched the pastures far and wide,
Another door, he flings it wide,
'- Only the solemn choral ode!
Once he heard, near his abode,
His hair cut neatly a la mode,
Into society he rode.
Their carriage wheels, briskly rode,
On my troubled mind intrude.
Been spared this deep inquietude,
To whom in rural solitude,
Lost in our rural solitude?
She'd sit all day in solitude.
In the world's noise, or solitude,
He'd addressed a multitude
Out of its waxen cell, the bee
To tell iambic from trochee.
Like lost fading echoes flee,
The soft snow reaches to her knee;
Breeds ducks and geese, while at his knee
By fate's implacable decree.
Perhaps by some divine decree,
When, storm-wrapped, shall I be free
The coachmen by the fire free
And, in the aching heart, set free
I must give her letter, error-free,
At fifty tolerably debt-free,
Was he as vigorous and carefree
But one and all, in truth, agree
The heavenly drink, you'd agree,
Surely, my Reader, you'd agree
It's wretched (I trust you'll agree),
He's a menace in the first degree.
Chapter Three
The fruits of learning's golden tree,
Behind the stump of a nearby tree
Her little finger's traced, I see,
But, listen, Lensky, when shall I see
One a cockerel's head; and see
'Ah, Tanya, dear! Come, let me see -
While age, in spectacles, can see
And gazing in adoration see
With all the taste we used to see.
Had Tanya had the power to see
'To the left? Where? What's to see?' -
Don his spectacles to see
(The place where we began, you see)
This letter here, don't you see,
A frightful witch with a goatee;
As long as, on credit, they'd guarantee,
Where fashion's loyal devotee
He'd led a good and simple life,
Then Lensky falls, robbed of life,
In every vicissitude of life,
Found refuge from the storm of life,
Her days and nights alone, through life,
Pursued him endlessly through life,
Content forever with their life,
All the sad morning of his life,
He who yawns away his life
Nothing to occupy his life.
Then truly, in this life,
I'll introduce you. Upon my life!' -
(Though he thought that country life
Forgetting friends and city life,
Yevgeny swiftly grasps a knife,
At lies with which the press was rife,
And in the fierce storm and strife,
And tiresome pleasures full of strife.
Plants cabbages, and free from strife,
Like a shadow, or a wife.
A household, a neglected wife,
Their dinner-table and their wife.
Found, without rank, career, or wife,
At the campaign, the snow, his wife.
By his children and his wife.
With his relations and his wife,
By your good and virtuous wife,
Would soon settle his new wife)
You alone would be my wife.
'Yes, but who is she? - 'That's my wife.' -
At such and such a date, and age;
Now, when Eugene reached the age
Tired of the laughter of the age,
Reader of dreams to the age.
'Who'd have though it?' - 'What an age!
Women of a certain age,
Or gratitude from age to age.
Old monkeys of another age.
His taste was of a former age.
Oh, he had loved as in our age
Rest, poet, from your pilgrimage.'
And since he never read a page,
- 'Dear Cousin!' - 'Sit: it's like a page
In bonnets, roses, all the rage,
Those years of hope and tender rage,
Possessed of the poet's finer rage,
Diviner, and Chaldean sage,
An Almanack, of year eight vintage:
Fit only for our grandsire's stage,
On any fond face on this stage,
In one a ledger taken hostage,
A delicate and trembling ridge,
Stretched across to form a bridge,
Restlessness, an urge for change
Though some of us are born to range.)
Now is the moment of revenge,
- 'Then send your grandson, and he
My hearts ablaze, I cried: 'It's he',
Enchantment fails such men as he,
In deep forgetfulness, does he
The gloomy eccentric, where is he,
Her eyes are opened, it is he!
'To whom, my dear, who is this he?
In his soul, so worthless he
A bon mot, with a fierce headache,
Heels, and leaps, and long moustache,
Her same friend Monsieur Finemouche,
Is ignorant of deceit, and still she
For several days thereafter she
The Enchantress, Winter: here is she!
And what of her sister, where is she?
The rustling curtain as we breathe
It seemed she could barely breathe;
The orchestra, the stalls, they seethe,
He'd not allow a man to die
Would chase me about, fit to die.'
Her face, like one about to die.
"Why the devil can't you die?"'
Just anyhow and let him lie,
Eugene continues to lie
To his defence should slander lie;
Frost's silver powders on it lie.
R�veillez-vous, belle endormie.
At more beefsteak and Strasbourg pie
Or some poetic reverie
Long hours of idle reverie!
You, phantoms born of reverie,
Lost in the depths of reverie,
Recited, as in reverie,
Plunged endlessly in reverie,
Lost in her own deep reverie,
Her dearest friend was reverie,
And lost in endless reverie;
(Lepage's make, of course) and tie
Enough to make the ballroom shake,
A walk beside the lonely lake,
His rest; girl reapers, keen to slake
And fail to offer a word, to make
Then come Cupid, imp and snake,
He followed still, for customs sake.
In ease and innocence I take
Deceived - a welcome rest would take.
It's late; and time for him to take
Where the ploughman likes to take
Five more paces now they take;
Lensky, keen to avoid mistake,
At the mazurka, floors would quake,
While weary servants half-awake,
Where shall we find your like?
An empty phantom, or a joke,
Shutters part, chimneys smoke,
For two long minutes neither spoke,
Saying: 'You wrote to me, I broke
A shepherd's pipe wakes the dale.
A victim, decked out for the gale...
The history of the passing gale,
With that my readers I'll regale,
The cattle low; a nightingale,
Garden, roofs, and fences, pale;
Of smoke scarce visible, soft, pale,
Hidden from the world: while pale,
Beside which Chateaubriand's pale,
The veteran is stirred, grows pale,
What dreams or cards portend, grew pale
Then nature trembles, deathly pale,
I might try to tell the whole tale,
Some profoundly moral tale,
In night's deep silence, tells its tale.
No fear and menace in my tale,
Tanya believed in every tale,
The radiance dies: there the vale
Or end a letter with vale,
She wanders through a snowy vale
Whose capital he's proved able
And Strasbourg pies, renowned in fable;
China and bronzes fill the table,
A roast-beef, rare, adorns the table,
To keep from the gambling table.
In all, not unacceptable,
Is carved in stone, immutable.
'Oh there'll be no end of babble,
And the crowd, all the rabble...'
'Then happiness seemed possible,
Sometimes proud, sometimes humble,
Force you to lie awake, and mumble.
All attentive, or just mumble!
Our neglected bridges crumble,
Prompt a dream, or article;
Anywhere, start, end, or middle,
Lines too short, long, or a riddle,
Once more resigned to being idle
The thoughts of other men to rifle;
To show themselves, twirl, and jingle,
Shine, conquer, and retreat, still single.
His epigrams topped up with bile.
Derzhavin, lingering here a while
Timidly, once in a while,
Speak of this and that a while;
His mind, still malleable the while,
Thinking of Eugene, all the while,
The world received her with a smile,
He heard our Lensky with a smile,
Like rose-red lips without a smile,
In decent company, and smile,
Encouraged by his Olga's smile,
A simple letter, free of guile,
With witticisms forged with guile,
Without a hint of hate or guile,
Russian without such faults is vile,
Resolved to hate the false, the fickle,
Translated the sublime Corneille,
Nasce una gente a cui l'morir none dole.
Was revealed, recorded whole,
Is found disturbing, on the whole,
The foolish dreamer sees them whole
And played an honourable role,
How perfectly she plays her role!
And played a wholly different role,
But, God, what tedium to sample
Let us all follow his example!
Like the poet's life as simple,
Who with radiant light would wrestle,
About the weather, crops, and cattle...'
The hand no longer drives the cattle,
To the spinning-wheel's low rattle,
Tea, and jam, and endless prattle,
I read a lot, I doze a little,
Careless of fame, the brittle.
But then at eighteen that's the rule;
Whom Epicurean maxims rule,
You've intoxicated me in style!
Then they're off again in style,
Suits the likes of you and me?'
Tayana's letter's here before me,
- 'Don't think...truly...don't accuse me...
- 'Oh, Nurse, you won't refuse me.' -
Last night what a fright you gave me!
May speak, like a fond friend, of me.
Oh God, what must he think of me?'
Then listen now, in secret, with me.
What has all that to do with me,
She'd visit every spot with me,
The cards, and play whist with me,
I'm muddled now!'... 'But Nurse, tell me,
H'm! My valued Reader, tell me,
That stirs dark epigrams within me,
And in Caucasian gorges, join me,
Considers vulgar. (Pardon me...
And he must never mention me...' -
My Tanya's, appeared to me,
In quiet, did you not speak to me,
Cousin, it's like a dream to me...
And yet how sad you seem to me,
Your candour: that is dear to me,
All poets, it seems to me,
Or a decent fellow - you or me,
Have wandered far enough, for me,
I too recall....ah, not for me,
One I adored, but now it bores me.
In spirit, he abandons me
No matter: a just fate awaits me.
Of the poet, this world forget me,
You might enjoy it, so allow me,
In winter-time. Please, follow me:
Open the window then sit by me.'
But back now to our theme: Madame,
At tea too sweet, banal Madame,
Obtaining wealth, and rank, and fame,
To ease heart's suffering, find fame:
Earn me the first fruits of fame,
Both had wearied of the game,
But I was mute, foolish in the game.
No flavour of the social game,
The fear of error, and of shame,
Burning suddenly with shame,
Rooted to the ground, in shame.
Noise, incomprehension, blame!
Open myself to endless blame,
Of Writers: whom I cannot blame
The glow of the poetic flame,
Like stone and water, ice and flame,
In both our hearts a dying flame,
That thirst for truth, toil's midnight flame,
She halts, as if scorched by flame,
Her breast heaves, her cheeks aflame,
Around the hour the French name
On him, when he heard his name,
More than usual?' 'No, the same.
I love a friendly glass, the same,
Into the shadows, still the same,
Discarding friends to win the same;
No two men were less the same
Since, I'm one too and just the same.
A thing the winter cannot tame;
Fevered rhyme on such a theme
Touching lightly on each theme,
By the lake I'll walk, the chime
Her eyes: the bell towers chime,
Until his Breguet's sleepless chime
But summer in our northern clime,
Learnt to endure their colder clime;
Our grandchildren think it no crime
Age demands prose for a time,
And wake her many and many a time,
Who only ripened in good time;
Though we decried them, at the time.
Flashes by, and in no time
That stands impervious to time.
Yet in frozen winter time
To crowd us out before our time!
Has met his fate before his time,
I hold that stirrup, blessed by time,
'A story, Tanya? In my time,
Tells him, now is dinner-time.
Estimable Reader: come,
Of park and palace, spire and dome,
With all its mysteries of home.
It's as monotonous as home.
As they fly like arrows towards home.
Borne away to change at home.
Every salon high and handsome,
Since time began; so, he'd resume
Watching the molten wax assume,
Age drives away the urchin, rhyme.
Exhausted by regret, and rhyme,
He's lost: the votary of rhyme,
From passing thought, enduring rhyme,
I knew scores and scores, in rhyme,
Felitsa's virtues set to rhyme -
Like modern verse, our empty rhyme,
I thought I'd paint (See Chapter One)
Through my garden, once urbane
Seated by the window pane
Breathing on the icy pane,
As the shadows slowly wane,
I painted over this sad scene,
Through the fashionable scene,
Scene after dull, exhausting scene,
But, perhaps this winter scene
Aware that Lensky and Eugene,
And beside her, her Eugene -
Who is the man? Is this Eugene?
The Princess gazes at Eugene,
And there, where bold Melpomene,
It sparkles, like the Hippocrene.
So unapproachable, serene,
Like the majestic moon serene
His three roans in a troika. Fine,
And all their voices now combine
Before the young man's death, he'd dine,
Now at last, it's time to dine!
Peace and quiet - such the fine
 - 'Nurse, it's nothing, I feel fine.
And though a womaniser fine,
Only what anger may define.
Clarissa, Julie, or Delphine;
Their family, or the hounds, no shine
To me - joyous things that shine,
Names like Akulka, not C�line.
A shadow, pale. Ah, for one line!
Here's his study, he'd recline
Life without albums, waists, Pauline,
Go now, take this note of mine.' -
In that sweet golden youth of mine:
All that is glad, lives, never mine -
To cry aloud: 'She's mine, she's mine!'
And sees herself the heroine
Alas, excessive) and the wine,
To sing for the guests above the wine;
A bottle of sparkling wine,
Endless bottles of sparkling wine
Concerning harvesting, or wine,
Smoky bottles, tarred with twine,
Byron was there - and novels, one
Yet ours, though he may be one,
Himself! I thought: "He's the one,"
His wife was quite another one,
Who sends me to sleep, all were as one;
Though not indeed that she was one,
To my Tatyana, all is one.
A poet? No, he wasn't one,
To the young hostess, one by one;
Our days of youth, now past and done)
And quiet her voice: 'Have done,
Yet as Albani might have done;
He waits till the mazurka's done,
In your traces: now youth's done,
He ends the struggle and has done.
Absorbed by remorse at things done
Indifferently, the game is done,
Morning comes: the dark is done,
God! How I erred, and am undone!
Lamenting what is done and gone;
And then, while you were gone,
'What that fat general?' - 'He's gone!'
But no! Not a bit of it, he's gone.' -
He leaves again, and home has gone,
Of boredom to her spouse, was gone...
Wish, dream, regret for what was gone,
'Nothing,' he answers, and is gone.
With starlit crowns; the track is gone;
Until her strength is all but gone.
Tatyana's bloom is all but gone,
That was ordained by fate, alone...
A flower in deepest grass, alone,
We think the others noughts, alone
On her balcony, alone,
The nurse. 'It's love. Leave me alone.'
One loves no longer; one alone
My mind in torment, I'm alone:
Racing the meadowlands alone
She'll brood, or roam the woods alone.'
To any but ourselves alone.
Our Yevgeny was not alone
An exile, and bound to none,
Another? ....No, no there's none
Forgo the city's ceaseless drone.
The tale forgotten and the stone;
Will halt her horse beside the stone,
Though great, our poet is immune
Always partly out of tune,
Clear and serene his tune,
And sings, and plaits a lime-bark shoe.
Sliding on ice, with his worn shoe,
She rushes to him, on tiptoe,
Perhaps too (oh, flattering hope!)
Some fool may yet achieve a trope,
Go riding on the empty steppe?
Yet Tasso's murmured octaves are
And curious as young girls are,
From a novel, yet here you are...!' -
Or enjoy the funeral, as you are.
If I were a poet, as you are
His heart the tempest now stripped bare,
With all their mysteries laid bare;
He's pining, with heart laid bare,
With vulgar tales is coarse and bare.
Birch, and lime, and aspen bare,
Dog-eared, with the cover bare,
As some deceit the eye lays bare,
Blessed the day of toil and care,
I'll go, I'll go' - At once, with care,
In the margins where, with care,
Onegin spoke of them with care,
Sentimental, free from care,
She seems to neither see nor care,
He noticed nothing, did not care.
Love yourself, your only care,
Eavesdropper, don't you dare
A black-cowled monk, or if a hare
Ready to save his honour, share
She feels are things she should share,
- 'Not at all.' - 'Well, I declare,
On the far bank, the smoky flare,
For fortune-telling they prepare
Repay him: and with joyful stare,
Haunted by one thought, his stare
If she met, all unaware,
Yet, should you succeed, beware,
She stumbles on - and yet, beware,
As dazzling as a flashing sabre,
A love that's innocent, sincere.
But now a clink of spurs, and here
Don't disavow it, I find here,
His daily round I'll describe here,
'But oh, the expense, not like here!' -
God grant you found a trifle here,
The bear speaks: 'Friends live here,
Farewell! No lingering here,
Not without cause I hail them here.
Into Olga's album here,
And seems an utter alien here,
All hope, all you who enter here.'
It's plain that he's the master here,
Then Olga's suitor, Lensky's here:
The one awaited....he is here;
Darling, how long can you stay here?'
Beneath this stone, rests quietly here.
Glowing, in a crystal sphere,
Tanya watches the moon's sphere,
Move in their harmonious sphere...
To a frail bed in a corner, there,
The Spanish ambassador, there,
A fisherman's fire: Tanya there,
The master often brooded there.'
His mind a whirl, he wandered there.
She left, yet still Eugene stood there,
For the simple churchyard there,
For that evening. 'She'll be there...!
His friend for his own presence there,
Trusted also his friends were there
There's very little pleasure there.
Recalling many a lost love there
On a pine-branch bending there
Heaped with snow; glittering there
Killing the hours dozing there?'
That I should wed...all paths from there
With glittering eyes Onegin there
The door flies open, Olga's there,
Through the hall, our hero's there,
Round the carriage, she was there,
Nothing touched his feelings there,
Blessed the tomb's darkness there.'
My two youthful hermits there;
Unconsciously, apparent there:
Of its inscription, feel pity there,
Go, arm in arm to table, where
Adam Smith was more his tome, where
Our old modest dwelling, where,
'Where have you been, Onegin, where?
Carried in dream to that land where
Onegin, to the theatre where
His thoughts were lingering elsewhere,
And, mist on meadows everywhere,
Can it be true, and not a mere
My springtime's over, in the sere?
A single image as it were:
Meadows silver, sunlight meagre...
Nurtured by the mob, no dire
Imbued with true poetic fire,
The ladies sit beside the fire;
In a corner, by the fire,
And spirit finds creative fire.
At home, impatient, breathing fire,
Slowly, by his slumbering fire,
White Moscow, stone and blazing fire
Prepared for sacrificial fire:
Poor Tatyana was on fire,
Waiting there, her cheeks on fire,
They're never worth the singer's fire,
Despite her beauty bright as fire,
The double windows, cosy fire,
Though he'd occasionally misfire
And end, himself, in the mire,
Yet bored again by conquest's mire;
Her idol, someone to admire,
My Muse with a grand soire;
Is the blood-sucking Vampire,
With Russian hammer, he'll aspire
With sighs or flattery, to aspire
Despite all efforts, or aspire
The whispering girls elsewhere conspire;
Then disenchantment, bored desire,
He lacked the passion and desire
But Lensky, lacking the desire
To tempt her with his base desire.
Pure devotion his desire,
Snug as a marmot might desire;
The rural dancers now retire
Sleep deserted her entire.
Wished sincerely to acquire
That our Yevgeny found a bore,
Didelot too is quite the bore.'
Kind and tender than before.
Then play a note or two before,
He read, at random, as before;
Love my hero, as before,
Carry the weapons, as before,
Is he as strange now as before?
To speak about the night before,
Where only fair Terpsichore,
Ended on the Black Sea shore,
How often to the Tauric shore,
Or the granite of the shore.
Beside that nameless river shore,
There beside the Neva's shore,
Perhaps you've seen, on Neva's shore,
It's time to leave this tedious shore,
An illustrator's dream, and more,
My thanks. I took my joy, and more...
His leave, his heart crushed, once more,
Onegin counts the hours, once more;
Vladimir shuts the book once more,
He pursues, or something more,
A faithful shadow, nothing more;
At least their words seeming more,
I'll return to him: no more!
Was heard at the Larin's no more:
The like of them, one or more.
Won't kiss the ladies' hands, what's more
Every dawn produces more
No use it seems, any more:
But broods on what he must ignore:
What future does fate hold in store?'
Malfil�tre
How love to the tomb will endure;
Far from Italy's allure.
Enough! Again, my soul is pure;
That table nearer; I'll be sure
Tasting the crowd's idle pleasure,
Where lovers of life's simple pleasure
Was it not, with such pure pleasure,
Entirely of his vengeful pleasure;
All the shades of wintry pleasure;
Was bored again beyond all measure,
She quietly took her husband's measure,
Gives us the first snow's measure,
And never fully plumb its measure.
For wilful passion was my measure,
I treat it as a sacred treasure,
As for finding ancient treasure
In their hours of work and leisure
Dear liberty and leisure.
Our bored Yevgeny's place of leisure
Drive the dogs off, to ensure
The clamour of a wake; unsure,
Two hearts, some flowers, a torch assure,
(Since, fond of contradiction, Nature,
The power to rule, in every feature,
Who in this calm, majestic creature,
Fluff her hair to suit, dear creature,
And soon reveal their better nature,
Ones whose Mamas plot his capture.
His heart forever burned with rapture,
From the local camp, what rapture!
For rural silence, where the lyre
Beyond my importunate lyre,
The world he wandered with his lyre,
Enough of my loquacious lyre,
Gazing at the glowing pyre,
And not forget the pistol-case.
French he spoke and wrote with ease,
I'll breathe free, take my ease
When their unbridled stirrings cease,
Ingenious London without cease
Did all that was required to please.
May this, my epic, if you please,
Silent, chattering, as you please,
And slips away, as chance may please,
Kissing her dear feet as they please!
Her heartache feels like some disease,
At the moon's meaning, each chill phase;
I leave such quiet haunts as these
(A predilection we should praise).
I live, I write but not for praise;
A hymn can reach, or people's praise,
Apuleius won my praise,
From the heart's true paradise;
Else paradise is no paradise.
Eugene came to apologise,
That instant, and not recognise,
Worn out by the ballroom's noise
The merchant and the beggar rise,
Alas! From life's dark furrows rise
For capture again, should that arise,
On reading their sad tale - surprise
'But where on earth,' with surprise,
All are watching in surprise,
Show neither anger nor surprise,
So morning brought no great surprise
No matter, hope in childish guise
Turn to her; and every guise,
Poor Tanya, in her new disguise?
Society, in short? What I'd advise
The useful arts, can devise,
Seeking its meaning from the wise.
Is: change your ways, if you're wise.
Of despair, burn flattery's incense,
But only a yard, strange, immense,
What are they? I could dispense,
To avoid the usual expense
Not as a man of honour, sense.
For but a moment, mind and sense -
Of post-horses, it made sense
At first they make but little sense,
Though they seemed devoid of sense.
And there grew wild as they: all sense,
Here no conscience, there no sense,
His partnering Olga too, what sense
Far off, invades her every sense.
A sprinkling of commonsense,
Some long fairytale's wild nonsense
Or a young girl's letter, pure, intense.
Her silent passion's more intense,
Neither pedantic nor intense,
And brought the visit to a close;
Such stuff as Lafontaine's suppose...
At this Zaretsky promptly rose,
Truly his star is in eclipse!
Lowered eyes their gleams eclipse,
At nothing, pathway, lake, or copse,
Onegin (once more I rehearse
All forgotten, and rehearse
Tend his roses, and rehearse,
In the names that we rehearse
Will often food and drink rehearse,
Our ancient customs shall rehearse.
She never chose to rehearse.
The praise the endless tides rehearse,
(That I'd once happily rehearse)
On his own madness, to immerse
Conceit of elegiac verse,
Retired, to write undying verse,
Books of sentimental verse,
(To say nothing of our verse),
Love's enchantments: and my verse
That the substance of my verse
Or else that Demon of my verse.
For the Father of the Universe.
Which their friends will all endorse
The best dog, Dasher: he's the horse,
Exits, calls loudly for his horse,
Gripped by feelings of remorse,
At once he's tortured by remorse,
All hope is lost! He leaves: a curse
The bench beside her, where the nurse
Tatyana had no doll to nurse,
You'll often have seen, of course,
And so she wrote in French of course ...
His fingers frostbitten of course,
He curses woman's reckless course,
Though the house is empty, use
But you, disciple of the Muse,
Nor hours given to the Muse,
Join me and my capricious Muse,
You acted rightly, in my cause,
Gone, with the fashions we abuse,
Elle �toit fille, elle �toit amoureuse.
That room to sit in, read, and muse.
Aunts and mothers keeping house,
The heavy friendship of a spouse?
This unrewarding t�te � t�te,
So on Shrove Tuesday always ate
Zaretsky, once a reprobate,
For reasons that I'll indicate.
Of fashions always out of date,
Will at some far distant date,
This house, the soires, my whole fate,
For some malignant blow of fate.
Might have met the usual fate,
And not abandon me to fate.
Of beaus and Circes speak her fate! ...
Would thank the heavens for their fate.
Tell the story of your fate.
You now consign your fate.
Pine for you, and mourn your fate!
The hour that must decide his fate.
I leave my hero, to his fate:
Turn to my hero, lest his fate
Some stanza, preserved by fate,
Is carried far from her by fate,
I surrender, and my fate.
Who find November at the gate.
The servants gather by the gate,
This tinsel of a life I hate,
He dropped his gaze, began to hate
Are heard, perverse, insatiate,
The soul's fire cooling of late.
To call a last farewell: it's late;
Change of tone, starts to relate
And yet it's one I can't translate;
And now I must congratulate
The dove will soon forget its mate.
Gambler-in-chief, an intimate
Saved from Lethe's darkened spate.
Forever now, they separate.
Their absent masters to berate.
I share those tears that agitate:
He saw the poor girl's quivering state,
They held to, in their peaceful state,
So, Reader, in that sorry state,
Was in fact a fine estate,
Quarrelling over our estate.
Newly arrived on his estate,
On unknown faces, ranked, complete.
Slides to rest, her fall complete;
Eugene lies, his fall complete;
What foolishness, and what complete
Beside some lines still incomplete.
Before you, simply to excite,
All around her, glittering white.
The East is indolently white,
Of nobility of soul; yet spite
I only wish the words I write
On the next page let them write.'
In vain, your growing appetite;
The very girl, he'd kept her note,
Yet now, receiving Tanya's note,
Yevgeny read the gloomy note,
Who freely, ardently, once wrote
The tender style in which she wrote,
Took to the road, went post-haste,
Object of my verses chaste:
Such was Olga...you can paste
It's true we don't possess good taste,
And everything Parisian taste,
Garbed to the modern taste,
Enlightenment has been a waste
For idleness and sense to waste -
In agitation, his lorgnette,
And dangle the careless lorgnette.
Above 't(out) � v(ous), Annette';
Left the cradle, play flirt, coquette,
The heart of a confirmed coquette!
Tatyana is no cool coquette,
His happiness rare, and absolute.
To be forgiven; trembles; mute;
Fine inns too, all along the route.
And godly folk will institute,
She gazes: a discarded cue
From Griboedov took Chatzky's cue,
Not more, with an old blunt cue;
From my words take warning due,
Been fluent in her native tongue.
Still quivering there on her tongue.
Yet diplomatic, held his tongue.
Words that flowed from my tongue,
Like smoke dispersing in the blue;
Than they, in that celestial blue.
Of sky-blue eyes, a heavenly blue,
Was no surprise: so simple, true?
She lights the North: 'Now, tell me true,
However I wished to prove true,
To Champagne I'm no longer true,
My days are numbered, yet it's true,
More tender even, but as true:
She was no beauty, that is true,
Though over-zealous, it is true;
Seduced like our ancestor Eve,
Before the mirror, then would leave
They exit; Lenksy loth to leave.
For your pleasure, so be brave.
Your forbearance now I'll crave,
To dispute the entrance to the grave -
Love might have found a way to save
Yet Tanya scarcely seemed to grieve;
Two hearts there are, two that grieve
Perhaps, for him...And yet, why grieve?
Chapter Five
By the serpent who'll deceive,
His dressing room, I'll not deceive,
Until (a wealth of thanks conceive),
A poem in cantos, twenty-five!
Of comme il faut... (Shiskov, forgive:
Surely, then, you can forgive,
Youth is a fever, let's forgive
I can't translate that, as I live!)
A fierce desire to love and live?
Its madness and its rage to live.
Of cosseting one who's half alive;
And clog the Larin's steps and drive,
As neighbouring families arrive,
Then what an epic I'll contrive,
Puffing the pillows, you contrive
A light dinner, not too pensive,
A lively horse and responsive,
Its use to date is not excessive,
I love the word, it's so expressive,
Not cold at all, yet not effusive,
Calm, her gestures unobtrusive,
Nature's vulgar, over-active.
You may consider unattractive,
And then she squeaks (Oh Lord, above!)
And praised to the skies above,
Farwell beauty of skies above;
You may trust through storms above,
- 'Oh my child, Heavens above,
Drains his glass then, Heavens above,
Perched on a lyre a little dove,
Her confidante, her own sweet dove,
'Come to my golden chamber, love!'
And you, familiar woods I love,
The tongue of Petrarch and of love.
Spring, ah Spring! The time of love!
Considered as the art of love,
I'm...Nurse, you see...I'm in love.'
A tomb, a Cyprian shrine to love,
The ally she was born to love,
Of course, a tender beauty's love,
Talks of Olga: such is love!
To flee the place; She cannot move,
The less of use her efforts prove.
My lips from hers will softly prove
To greet them, and to hold her nerve.
Forced between her lips, will serve
Near young Tatyana, whom we
For long? ...Forever. For we,
The muddy pool, my friends, that we
When on the porch they said goodbye,
The hour when all must say goodbye.
The mile-markers soothe the eye,
What stirs there, hidden from the eye?
And still transparent to the eye
Blind with that mist that veils the eye.
With solemn look, and sparkling eye.
Our Tanya, no discerning eye,
Each one tried to catch her eye;
Watching its flight with anxious eye,
Squints, half-closes his left eye,
Five versts from Krasnogorye,
Triquet rises, with noble gaze;
And let the proud and mocking gaze
Faced with her open, tender gaze,
While he devours her with his gaze.
Since, foretelling to my gaze
Sledge rides; and the far-off haze;
Know lives in a dreamy haze;
Jealousy gone, and anger's blaze,
Flares in her face, those eyes ablaze,
Standing there, his eyes ablaze,
The noise subsides, and faces glaze;
News from town, the latest craze,
The sound of hooves! ...Sent to freeze
Drunk as an owl, a Frenchman's prize,
Nearby (when the furrows ooze
Make way, retrieve a handkerchief.
That distance, quencher of belief,
Know you as I, share your belief:
Part liveried ranks, to bring relief,
Consoled her and brought relief.
      There, where days are cloudy and brief,
Ever habitual pain and grief,
The inexperienced come to grief.
Nothing else could end her grief,
In peaked cap, hair full of fluff,
The French cuisine's finest proof,
And gave his neighbour's ribs a dig.
Its sails a creaking whirligig;
A windmill dances a wild jig,
Asked her name, straightened his wig,
I thought Onegin's talk disturbing
With the others, sweetly dancing.
Is where that fair song is heading:
Spend the time indoors, reading?
Her father saw no harm in reading,
Girls prefer The Kitten's Wedding.
A decent sort, though yet conceding
Her, while to her ear confiding,
He dances, nonchalantly guiding
Became a bore, it seemed, unending.
I'll recall the words of longing,
I've learnt to know another longing,
Silently impart love's teaching!
How heavy the emotion weighing
To her nurse is softly sighing.
The joy and pain she's cherishing,
The hall is crowded, shoving, pushing,
Young girls kissing, noise and crushing.
Could never yet conceal a thing,
'Look to the left, now, there's a thing.' -
And time gives nurture to the thing.
Challenge that, but here's the thing,
My eyes in vain seek out the thing
Breathing one thing, loving one thing,
Considered it a certain thing.
Ready to faint, alas, poor thing,
Betray me, while you poor thing
Or a hare trembles, hapless thing,
And, exiled for that very thing
Rushes to lift her, swiftly sheathing
In his grasp, and barely breathing;
No one is there, beyond its seething,
Dreaming, understanding nothing,
This perpetual sterile talking,
Takes to the garden, walking
Issue an angry challenge, thinking
Wine by the bottle, never blinking,
A mason, and forever drinking,
With some nonsense while your drinking,
Thus the country view of hooking
Save us, how well you're looking!
Lensky, wealthy and good-looking,
The dogs run towards her, barking,
A noisy crowd; and fighting, larking,
Cries: 'Cease your endless squawking,
Now imagination's dealing
Tanya was blushing, trembling.
While reading, on both mind and feeling,
'What is it Tanya, dear?' 'It's trifling:
'I can't sleep, Nurse; it's stifling!
A Horse Guard's spurs go jingling,
In pursuit, the dancers mingling;
They've come to an old aunt who's ailing
Consumptive, four years past, and failing.
To bring his medicine unsmiling,
Carried away by his brave calling,
He made his name by simply falling:
I'd not set the ages quarrelling.
In the old way, maids foretelling
Must be worn out with travelling;
See, my early bird, my darling,
Dusk falls, the samovar is gleaming
Frosted glass; and far hills gleaming;
Magpies in the courtyard screaming;
Motionless, like one dreaming,
Blood from his wound is streaming,
It glows and hisses, softly steaming,
One melancholy jester leaning
And the hypocrisy, demeaning,
In the doorway, idly preening,
And fed you cake!' Tanya's barely listening
'How Tanya's grown! Your christening
Picking berries in the evening,
As to where he'll spend his evening.
Accounts, drink, rage, the gloomy evening,
In the silent misty evening,
Now I must take to sounder reasoning;
Her dreams had long since set her yearning,
With not a thought in the morning
But now, from out the vales of morning
In solitude her heart was burning,
Opinion, keeps the whole world turning!
The new-born sun, the day is dawning,
'My dear Onegin, you're yawning.'
I'll set a few words echoing:
Honouring, where they lay sleeping,
Then too, with fervent weeping,
Sniffing, coughing, hissing, clapping.
Heedless of their friendly clapping;
Where Thalia is quietly napping,
The audience, their feet still tapping,
He pens, though she seems uncaring,
His illness makes him more daring,
Like a doe seen in a clearing,
Wenches and coachmen swearing;
While the breakfast is preparing,
Always the Frenchman, had to bring
This day to come, what will it bring?
A memory to the mind may bring
No more, dear feet, of wandering
Began an aimless wandering,
Of every joy and suffering.
Then poke Tatyana, whispering:
Revive. Two words, a whispering,
She heard our Lensky answering;
Orchestra already tiring,
Melancholy, wild, retiring,
'A habit Lensky.' 'You find life boring,
Heated by the warmth of spring,
Of another, older spring,
For it's our idol, honour's mainspring,
But later found it re-assuring,
Enters. The room is gyring,
It is of my young friend, I sing,
For Tanya, a song that children sing,
The one poor Ovid used to sing,
Do I hear once more your choir sing?
Far off a choir of girls sing
And I'll mention here, in passing,
She never took to caressing
Friends and friendship were confusing,
Faithlessness was not amusing
She's the subject they're debating:
Overwhelmed, near suffocating,
Love's violent pains, heart's beating,
He's off to Talon's, calculating
'Up now, and no procrastinating:
Onegin without hesitating,
But, the outcome of their meeting?
Then later, intimacies meeting,
Day and night, till our next meeting.
Utter a few words of greeting,
Past six, Onegin will be waiting.'
His friend Kaverin will be waiting.
At home they're already waiting,
Turned to the envoy, mutely waiting,
As if before some mournful parting,
Popping corks, and idle feasting,
Introduce me.' 'Now, you're jesting.'
This Phyllis, who's so interesting,
In yesterday there is no trusting;
How utterly himself forgetting!
Goodbye, Eugene, I must be leaving.'
Why are you so unforgiving?
To judging other ways of living;
Prevents her from even moving.
See a Russian Terpsichore wing
To beat once more its rainbow wing,
The wit of former days displaying,
On my heart, to feel the straying
Falling ill like that, and dying;
Here an ambassador conveying
By his better half is lying.
Tatyana, in the darkness lying,
At my mistress's feet lying,
Oh, you should have heard me crying,
Their fathers saw them marrying,
Admire it, as if he were trying.
The matchmaker spent two weeks trying
All's peaceful; in the parlour, vying
With passion's fire she is blazing,
Like a Bacchante, danced along
But then Larina crawled along;
To use their nags, and so prolong
Wooed by all that ardent throng,
Freedom's champion, ever strong
Vladimir thought him quite wrong,
Preventing them from doing wrong!)
In human rights, was here all wrong.
She gazes earnestly: 'What's wrong?'
A clever scheme of rural song,
Listen to our secret song,
A song we love, a merry song,
Lost now that power of being young.
Had never, even when young,
Blessed is he, who in youth was young,
Who, as the years went by unsung,
He visited at Christmas...Oh!
I offered little interest...ah,
The sober-headed, for whom each
Our Russian language, and yet each
His gaze inspired: how he could preach! -
Make conversation, and to teach
Each day he stands beside her coach,
His mind ignores all self-reproach,
When we see our lad approach,
Then by the stream, beneath the beech
Motivation, action, speech,
The poet's bold impassioned speech,
To don a mask, in form and speech,
Horses' hooves and human speech!
Didn't they mutilate our speech,
I'll record the honest speech
Bark, laugh, whistle, sing and screech,
Sad-eyed there, sits on a bench,
Clasps in her hand a book, in French.
The same husband, the same pooch,
Petrarch
Was thought something of a catch;
Any fish to make a match;
As it grows dusk he takes a sleigh:
Placing it carefully in the sleigh,
Makes a fresh road with his sleigh;
Along the Neva in his sleigh,
In procession, sleigh by sleigh.
Sang the maid on mountain high,
Onegin fires...the clock on high
To hit the head, or break a thigh.
Indifferent to the world's delight
And with southern oceans nigh
Our secret balm, a tear, a sigh...
Dispassionately gave a sigh;
Dressed at dawn, she gives a sigh,
Tatyana moans then gives a sigh,
Our Tanya, not without a sigh,
Since even he at times would sigh
Silently to yawn and sigh
We'd never heard the word. One sigh
Thinking with a mournful sigh,
At last she gave a sudden sigh,
Like a reed-pipe, pure, her sigh:
A second quarrel, then they sigh,
The flower has faded from the bough,
Today...no wreath hangs on the bough,
It's fun, despite the pain he's in, though
That, search all Russia though,
- 'It's long since he was here though!'
His calculating neighbour though,
Rides off. A pair of pistols though,
We'll show off Tanya, a pity though
Enough. My shoulder's from the plough!
(You know the fellow, right enough);
Tatyana (Russian through and through,
In works of charity, all through
It's not my job to work them through.
But hear my confession through,
The housekeeper nods her through:
Triumphant you'll see winter through.
At the window, read it through.
As some old squire cuts a dash,
Their coachmen, seated, wield the lash
In sheepskin coats with scarlet sash;
Show respect to, love, and relish
But first what hopes you'll cherish,
Whom we are obliged to cherish,
Conceive it. No one here to cherish
My dear one you're doomed to perish,
Silently, I'm doomed to perish.
Where they fall, others flourish...
Appears consumptive in his anguish.
Onegin begins to languish,
Stripping forests, fierce and harsh.
Turning meadowland to marsh,
In his face the pains of death,
Tanya lies there, cold as death.
Contests their entry in a breath;
Hearing his last failing breath,
With cruel joke, or lying oath!
But by rule, and he was loath
Along the fragile bridge's length.
Or to examine her at length,
Now full of grief he lacks the strength
To help her cross, she gathers strength
Tatyana flies, as swift as faith,
'Eugene! Ah!' - Light as a wraith
To pride; he's first to drink her health,
Present his song-sheet, wish her wealth.
And earn a luncheon with them both;
A classicist, and pedant both,
Or less: what role? Perhaps Melmoth,
(Cursing the hour of his birth),
While the spouse, knowing her worth,
And you (its rhyme forever) youth?
Can it be love, the care of youth?
Besides, the enthusiasm of youth
Free, and in the flower of youth,
In the first bright flower of youth,
And truffles, luxuries of youth,
Had betrayed itself in youth,
For he was victim from his youth
Alas it's sad to think that youth
Oh my frivolous lost youth!
Golden springtime of my youth?
Confess it now, behold: the truth.
Love, or hate, it shouts the truth,
The dream! Where's sweet elusive truth?
While Cicero I loathed, in truth;
Vexation? Vanity? Or, in truth,
Midst glittering victories, in truth,
Was with Tatyana, not, in truth,
They're here before me, his in truth:
Unbridled passion was his truth.
Hourly we betrayed its truth,
Caricaturing him, Sen-Pri!
The country caused the same ennui
      L� sotto giorni nubilosi e brevi
Today, it is my turn to speak.'
Or chondria, when we Russians speak,
No one listens, they just speak,
Be in your presence, hear you speak,
It seems to him that it must break,
You preached: the strong to the weak?
A Muscovite in Childe Harold's cloak,
Slumber steals, the years roll back;
He brings' - she murmurs - 'and I lack
Had gripped her heart, as if a black
He drew a mourning veil of black.
Its brightly-coloured faro pack.
Across the literary stack,
A Kalmuck, in a ragged smock,
Flings wide the door, he holds a sock
As if a lightning bolt had struck.
And the flame in her cheek.
Diana's breast or Flora's cheek,
Yet Terpsichore's foot I'd seek
So a poor butterfly will seek
The cause of which it's time to seek,
To see you but once a week,
Hoot or argue, shout or shriek.
Fizzing, and amidst the talk,
Blue columns rising over folk,
Lightly sketched, with wash and ink,
The aunts, unsure what to think,
His dream's mute monument, a link
Nudge each other, slyly wink,
The steward came; he'd read a book...
At any more demanding book.
His dumb remorse; an open book
And with what storms his body shook!
Till Lensky, with abstracted look,
Achieved in her conceited look,
His frail appearance, wasted look,
The heart alive with kiss and look;
The old man had no time to look
'Never you mind that, just look...
See here too, my old master's nook;
With his pawn took his own rook.
Shadowy woods and crystal brook,
A moment: that was all it took.
Two, in uniform; he hardly took
Of deep passions, ancient, dark;
Now an underline; now a dark
Pleasant to see it hit the mark,
Comment; now a question-mark.
A mild rebuke, a sharp remark,
It's pleasant with a sharp remark
Then off to ramble in the park.
Freed now of its dampened cork,
Or some mistake grammatical,
His spirit egotistical,
On the page, on the word ideal,
And farewell you, my true ideal,
I'd find in you my heart's ideal,
Find that youthful folly real,
Soars, glistening half-ethereal,
Elegy penned a madrigal.
Though she requires a madrigal!
Ever Love's most alluring vial,
A sight of the true original,
What ails him? Is it some strange coal
His virgin fire a living coal.
Of honour: ready - it was his goal -
Life was a riddle, and its goal
Rank demands, achieves its goal!
He chose - a more than worthy goal,
Lensky, for a funeral
And anticipate his funeral.
He liked debate, to point a moral,
A creature heartless and amoral;
You rustic Priams, elemental,
And all you ladies sentimental -
And so grew old, like all things mortal,
Knowing all our joy is mortal,
Its fate in death's gaping portal,
Through the grave's gloomy portal,
Perfumes in finely-crafted crystal;
And to delight the sensual
My little book. In you, I feel,
Ignorance of the pain I feel!
One with a fashionable feel.
You showed respect then...now you kneel.
A devil in pride, or yet an angel,
Are you then my guardian angel,
Cunningly begin a quarrel,
Louder and louder grows the quarrel,
Volume Three of Marmontel
Keen to avoid her, before the duel,
But soon we saw our plans unravel,
Onegin and I planned to travel,
Then in the crowd inside that hovel,
Betrayed, a husband from a novel,
Who but the hero of our novel?
The imprint of his fingernail,
To follow him, pursued the trail,
You're curious for every detail,
Woods cloaked with a silver veil;
The fire dies down; the ashes veil
Spring calls you to the fertile soil,
Warmth, growth and outdoor toil,
Or my tempter, force of evil:
As some suspicious aged devil,
Cries, the clash of glasses, all
But the pleasantest thing of all
Then know: I'd rather suffer all;
Yet wretched the man who foresees all,
Onegin has outpaced us all.
And lost in misty moonlight all
Cannot but despise it all,
A little pale and thin, but all
O country life! I like you all,
Cheerfully, I'd give my all
A birthday party, here a ball.
May I never meet, at a ball,
Better to hurry to the ball,
And all is brilliance at the ball.
Hearing fresh whispers sigh and call?
Where will my young idler call?
The old crone comes at their call,
That Onegin is not me, recall
To imbibe it, friends: recall?
All still the same as we recall;
'I'm weeping....if you still recall
The pain of time lost, past recall:
Of leaves that vanished in the fall,
Can scarcely wait for night to fall.
Is hateful, in its essence, gall;
Prompting something steeped in gall,
The bear has gone; she's in a hall;
Flies to the house, through the hall,
Ushers Tanya through the hall,
The crowd spills into the hall,
Lord Byron's portrait, by a small
Still hold half the world in thrall,
To the magic bow in thrall,
The clouded moon, and on the wall
Was he from Heaven or from Hell,
In this fashionable monk's cell,
For your enlightenment, to spell
Our friends now are in its spell.
Mastered I've no time to tell,
Today we know, truth to tell
Something of what these stanzas tell.
Though why, I can hardly tell.)
One thing alone he studied well,
Still forever, fare thee well.
But it grows late; the wind as well
Though in exchange he took as well,
Are all your relations well?
And so we part, again farewell!
It's bound at least to make me ill.'
She shivers as if she were ill,
He thought: what folly to work ill
Tried to write, it makes him ill
You're in a fever...' 'No, I'm not ill:
The poet's soul from every ill,
Of whom she could not get her fill,
The darkened river, vapours fill;
Windows pale within, that fill
The invalid's kind words must fill
There is a stream, and here a hill,
The moon is hidden by a hill;
By the third, field, wood, and hill,
To the stream below the hill.
The sarcastic and the chill
Then take his way, despite the chill,
Another dream, and one more chill,
Whose heart, experienced, grown chill,
In society's toils that kill,
Though that cranberry juice may kill:
Borrow your bewitching skill,
He's in, and flying to the mill.
All was as grist to his mill;
Derzhavin, at the grave's dark sill,
All this fresh to Onegin, till
All is silent, shuttered, still,
She finds all unfamiliar, still,
Words upon his lips were still.
The noble ode's great master still;
Listens to the young bloods still.
The fight is done, the sword is still,
He frowns - and everyone is still;
Read, thus, sundry Russians still,
May the Good Lord preserve us still!' -
Scattered reams with flying quill,
Translate my Tanya, with a will,
And in his hut, with a will,
Arrived, asks Guillot if he will
But now her reason and her will,
Betrothed though against her will:
Arresting her against her will.
All is over: to your will
No longer even stirred his will,
No longer forgets itself, at will.
He drinks - the creatures howl and swill,
The child with her obedient doll,
No, passion took no greater toll,
However much it takes its toll,
Their questions pointless, dry and dull;
Stale gossip, news, of that they're full,
Of rank and age with which the hour's full.
Mounts a goose's neck, a skull!
Prepares herself for protocol,
Second: the poet might be a fool,
You acolytes of Levshin's school,
Yevgeny should have shown control,
Summon sufficient self-control
His hand to Olga, leads the girl,
Would recognise the tender girl?
Detesting all the social whirl,
Yet he'd once set her heart awhirl!
Gazes unseeing at the swirl,
Among the guests; they swiftly twirl;
A pipe of amber from Istanbul,
The shadows thicken, till a dreadful
Always humble, always truthful,
Sits a crayfish; wonderful,
The conversation of the powerful,
Alight in his cold, torpid soul?
In Onegin's form, and soul.
Yet a modern Regulus, the soul
Or that a fiery headstrong soul
Could alter Lensky's loyal soul,
And whatever stirs her soul,
He ought to do so - will your soul
He'd made pencil marks, his soul
As emptiness possessed his soul,
The doubts that stirred in his soul
That sad protest in his soul,
Nor ever so consumed my soul!
Zizi, the crystal of my soul,
I thank you now, with all my soul...'
A scholar, in a yellow shawl,
But, lighted by Diana's gleam,
Her overflowing heart, love's gleam.
And on the rustic bench's gleam
And its attendant rivulets gleam,
To where the silent shallows gleam,
Covered with sheets of downy gleam;
A serving-lad hands round the cream.
Veiled in mist, as in a dream,
That young girl...is it a dream...?
A horn rings out, enchanted dream,
Enriched by meditative dream.
A harmless, and delightful dream.
And with Olga, lost in dream;
Return; that innocent, her dream,
To find her passion, and her dream,
Is turned to silver. From it's dream,
Always the one pure constant dream,
Shines with mist. Here a stream
The lonely grove where a stream
Levels the borders of the stream,
He plunged, head first, into the stream,
We'll take the trail towards the stream,
Through the borders, gains the stream,
Ever desire's habitual stream,
Alive again on memory's stream.
A drop of that dark fragrant stream;
From the cradle, the slow stream
Swims across the drowsy stream,
Yet make the ladies smile, un-clam
Steel bits and traces flecked with foam,
But our Onegin's off to roam,
Walk? The countryside you roam
Here, one who'd aim an epigram
Though it's perfect for an epigram...).
With some ready epigram.
The seal with her monogram,
Follow in Petrarch's steps, seem
Then like a very sage could seem
That young girl, it would seem
All, sombrely, surrounding them.
It's clear they're not eating them,
Laugh at whatever tickles them,
Happier he who never knew them,
Not yet attempting to aim,
What can I hope for? With what aim
Too dark for driving some would claim,
Yet sleep had barely laid its claim
Four fatal steps, to kill or maim.
Thank God no desire claimed him,
Had gradually overwhelmed him,
Dared clean his nails in front of him,
Where are the horses taking him?
Runs to his friend, gazes at him,
Swiftly, she flew to meet him,
Light as air, ran to greet him,
Grey trampled slush; yet, what's his whim?
Taught him everything by whim,
Could not conceive how haughty Grimm
'Do tell me, Prince, now, to whom,
Her soul was waiting...but for whom?
Finds delight to come, or doom;
And hungry wolves, that loom
Into the meadows, in full bloom.
Here was fashion's finest bloom,
A nightingale, from woodland gloom
Side by side, in the gloom,
Now cheerful, now full of gloom;
Is merely vague, and lost in gloom.
No gossip could dispel his gloom,
Crushed by adolescent gloom,
Dawn breaks in a chilly gloom,
Grows recklessly and fills the room,
He'd wander through a drawing room,
They crowd into the drawing room
Always together, in her room
The vault of heaven. Near her room,
The faces seen in every room,
Damask in the drawing-room,
Never pursue a phantom,
Long ago....It was no phantom!
To rescue it, as is his custom,
Entered, together, arm in arm,
Light flashes; Eugene lifts his arm,
No one finding any harm
As if to raise a magic charm
Yet she found a secret charm,
With too much life or wit, but charm.
Melds fascination with alarm)
And guaranteed not to alarm,
Shall not fade before its term.'
How many days since her form,
Each falling there as they form
Recall the sea before a storm,
A quiet retreat from the storm.
The vile and venomous worm
As saturnine romanticism.
Displays a hopeless egotism
He found it in some dusty album
Admire the dense and noisy hum,
Had she solved the conundrum,
It summons up respect, one can
I'm overcome, by pity I mean;
Gentle Reader: low and mean,
Take domesticity to mean,
And so my Tanya began
That plague of every modern Russian.
Handsome, young, a Kantian,
Or two, the age drawn with �lan,
Or cuckold, foolish, of that clan
Marry their daughter, was the plan,
His wastefulness and lack of plan.
I've sketched the underlying plan,
His nature, comprehend the man,
She does not try to raise the man,
Vladimir Lensky, is the man
The careful spouse as much his man,
'My uncle, what a worthy man,
A profile of contemporary man
To this half-Russian gentleman.
The less we show our love to woman,
Now our Eugene's a countryman,
In a soft whisper, gives a moan.
Is doomed to feel such love, and moan:
Me, or understand my moan,
Poet of the Giaour and Don Juan,
Old tales they were, fables laden
Seeing nothing there to gladden,
Deep in the woods, than do as bidden.
Oh, horror! Better safely hidden
With Evil spirits, a lovely maiden;
A glittering stream beside a garden!
Why not view the house, or garden?
Gazes at the empty garden,
Homeward, through the kitchen-garden;
I too cast off the social burden,
The valleys show a dappled sheen;
Would meet in the morning, keen
And Tanya all attention, keen
In that face Eugene was keen
Their very presence causes spleen.
As tedious phantoms? Is that spleen,
A time when, pursued by spleen
The naked woods show downy green.
On many pages could be seen
Not a tremor can be seen:
There was no trace to be seen,
Was just a lad, if you could have seen
Once, it's golden bubbles seen,
Among the wives and daughters seen,
To prejudices rarely seen
In little girls of scarce thirteen?
Us then, and I, I was just thirteen.
Whose soul was formed in G�ttingen,
In my nomadic exile, then,
Bringing boredom, anguish, then,
Go, little book: find Neva then,
To which we dedicated then
You visited them twice, and then
Through the frosted glass, and then
From his estate, perhaps: and then
All pierced her to the core; and then
I made a friend of Eugene then.
Not daring to stop, for then
How I envied the waves then,
A friend of truth: a poet then.
Your tears, verse, et cetera, when? ...
And rosy as Aurora when
Where had he come from, and when,
Are all such things quite alien
Lifted from the water, shaken,
Our past forever dead, forsaken,
For my Tatyana, long forsaken...
Then from a dish, rings are taken,
Ah, what treasures Fate has taken!
Or finding Nature re-awaken,
E sempre bene, gentlemen.
Must write true odes, odes gentlemen,
The ladies framed by gentlemen,
Sings of the Volga fishermen;
Though once they sang my gifted pen:
This idol for your mind, and pen,
Shall I depict with faithful pen
That's it, my friend?' - 'No! Your pen,
Then poetry flows from his pen,
The eager nonsense I may pen
I'll feed the proceeds of my pen.
The circle claps to make all happen,
The theatre fills, the boxes glisten,
That spleen (so Englishmen are bitten)
In love with fame, by freedom bitten,
An ironic stanza of how he's smitten.
The sickness, with which he was smitten,
Some army type too will have written,
What odes might Vladimir have written,
He arrives, the cork pops, heaven!
To Onegin. Dear God in heaven!
Like a hermit in his heaven,
Chapter Seven
The Comet's vintage, year eleven.
On summer morns, he'll rise at seven;
She can't. And why? Because she's given
Over-starched and rather brazen,
But she had heard of them a dozen
A soldier-husband, a campaign.
No mark of tears? ...No trace, no sign!
Another day, and still no sign,
Whatever trouble you are in.
Whom to love, whom to believe in,
Guests squeeze up to let them in,
Hours roll on, and then, again,
Promising, each year, again,
Full of love's foolishness, again
Hourly it cheated us, again:
Is dressed, undressed and dressed again?
A Lancer, who was loved again,
Then all was altered, and again,
Our wanderings and again
To lie at her feet, in peace again!
She's lost in thought now, once again;
Could they not speak and smile again,
Young and fond, pursue again,
As heaven dictates. You'll love again.
And rose from the bench again,
Never once called on them again:
My darkened mind grew clear again,
With the springtime showers again)
Will not be picked apart again,
Moscow, I dreamed of you again!
In the princess, Tanya plain:
It is Yevgeny,' sees him plain,
Music's magic, thought, and pain.
The torments of the soul, the pain,
All the trouble, and the pain,
Are born a people to whom death brings no pain.
Another care, profounder pain,
Flattery soon soothed her pain,
Yet virgin hearts, despite its pain,
Who could have seen her silent pain,
As the fields by springtime rain:
My thanks for every sweet refrain,
Cold yawns with their icy train.
And then...our hearts we must restrain,
In blissful sleep, it's certain,
And pulls aside the curtain;
Now, I no longer rush to stain
Before blood left its scarlet stain,
That fatal sweetness, though in vain.
Was granted to us all in vain,
Yet, after brief greeting, to begin
With icy baths his days begin,
Struck by an icy chill, Onegin
Lensky's here, and with Onegin,
A true Childe Harold, my Onegin
Monsieur L'Abb�, French and thin,
Yet he is yours, through thick and thin,
Rests, on the fantasy within,
More sure than that of friends or kin,
He loves you....like your dearest kin!
The missive gave a caustic grin:
In seduction's net of sin.
Times from her dear Moscow cousin,
The easier to snare and ruin,
The easier she is to win,
Like a drunken traveller at an inn;
While Eugene, frozen, lingered on.
What then? Though his eyes moved on,
This nightmare whirling, on and on.
She runs, he follows, on and on,
Walks on forever: on and on.
The clock runs swiftly on and on,
Enough, it's time now to move on!'
Breaks the lilacs, hurrying on,
'Should I turn back now, or go on? ...
Their branches, as she stumbles on,
'What is your name?' He moves on,
He's walking off...he's sideways on...'
He would neglect and then abandon.
In that, for rustic life to pardon.
Fate had granted, Napoleon,
In Moscow, he's near St Simeon,
His rustic answer: 'Agafon'.
No sign of the fevered tyrant, Fashion,
Ah, but then the whirl of fashion,
Both had known Fate's passing fashion,
Monsieur was packed off in brisk fashion,
Was driven, in no uncertain fashion,
Onegin was silent, in his fashion,
A soul so trusting, in that fashion.
Like him she wore the latest fashion,
When far ahead of his battalion,
He toppled from his Kalmuck stallion,
And then demands the cotillion.
Tired of this cotillion;
The poet burning with opinion
Who's affectation caused occasion
Bringing the science of persuasion
Who is not bored with evasion,
Tanya had news of the decision.
Politely, without indecision,
Lensky, coolly, with precision,
To punish me with your derision.
To face society's derision,
Another star had its ascension,
Yevgeny heard with condescension,
Yet the book has no pretension
Overcome with wit and passion,
Perhaps the ancient flame of passion,
And the waywardness of passion,
Both had known the play of passion
But regardless of such passion,
Her distress, her hidden passion,
The science of the tender passion
No one had divined her passion,
A missive that declares his passion.
Of restless youth's tumultuous passion,
And indignation's icy passion,
The dance-floor was my passion:
Stirred a flicker of compassion.
And no confusion, no compassion?
Pride's cold politeness, the procession
You deeply, by my sad confession:
Beseech, elicit true confession,
Onegin heard the poet's confession.
And as it ends, with this confession,
Of her own heartfelt confession,
How shall I add to my confession?
Free Chapter Five from more digression.
She likes the orderly progression,
On one and all a strong impression,
He gave heart and soul expression,
And then demand an expression
What bitter scorn in your expression,
Meanwhile Onegin's first session
Might have achieved its high mission,
Waited on Moscow's submission,
From the first, he'd spread confusion,
And then? Full of confusion,
Yet within my heart's confusion,
I'm blind to all its illusion,
Modest, tender, sweet illusion,
Gain trust, or cause pure disillusion,
We've all acquired some education
But her mounting trepidation
Every writer's fine creation,
A spirit tuned to all creation?
Who reads the works of his creation,
My newborn work, my sweet creation,
Hating all this litigation,
Their errors of pronunciation,
Breeds fear of reconciliation.
Tears of reconciliation,
Felt inexpressible elation,
A past acquaintance, and relation.
Inheriting, as sole relation,
Onegin, in this desolation,
Now, in her cruel isolation,
I know not, yet here's my translation,
Endless future tribulation.
There was no end of speculation,
Alone, engrossed in calculation;
Hosts of rumours in circulation,
But there was no capitulation,
In Russian, honouring our nation.
The histories of every nation,
Rise, now, this merits explanation.
Compassion, and indignation,
To rouse his friend to indignation,
To pass a note of assignation.
Secure a secret assignation,
Moscow....what depths of fascination
Now Tanya stares in fascination
Finds a deeper fascination,
Find fresh powers; Imagination,
A moment since, imagination
With profound imagination,
Each figment of imagination,
Love in imagination,
Shapes where her own imagination,
To leave his place of hibernation,
With no apparent consternation,
Make poetry their occupation;
From dawn, his only occupation,
But drawing-room pre-occupation
Was once my sole preoccupation.
Yet my Eugene's preoccupation
Fierce jealousy, sad separation,
Nor long years of separation,
How often, dumb with separation,
Nor study, nor loud celebration,
Lacks charm. The new generation,
Only a mighty conflagration.
To yield poetic inspiration,
Insomnia, pale inspiration,
Had fired this heart, pure inspiration,
'Whose glance, creating inspiration,
Long walks, and fresh inspiration,
And you, my youthful inspiration,
Thoughts of her his inspiration.
To products of my inspiration,
At those sisters' royal decoration,
The shy, sweet girl whose adoration
To the object of his adoration,
Now with greater concentration,
A poor second-hand illustration,
Compelling truth, or illustration,
Stir the same old sweet sensation.
The chatter, and the conversation,
There of wit, true conversation,
There's a lull in conversation,
Though it adds to conversation,
Generally their conversation
But merely pleasant conversation,
Of wit, froth, free of affectation,
But the world's scornful expectation
He wakes to a solicitation,
The fruits of my own meditation,
Such our young dog's meditation,
Who has cooled love's agitation
God be thanked, some imitation,
Which was he? Mere imitation,
Pale, incomplete, an imitation,
The servant's looks pure irritation.
And swore in deepening irritation,
The Prince has sent an invitation
In him the poet's exaltation,
He dreams of, in his exultation:
Your pure, pensive incantation?
At some vile novel's reputation,
Since, to preserve my reputation,
Between them every disputation
Finding it small deprivation,
The intellect's cold observation,
Forgetting Hymen's gifts, vexation,
Tatyana listened, with vexation,
His presence: kindness is vexation,
Who will fit their speech and action,
Bows to friends, then views the action,
In private judgement on his action,
Experienced but the one reaction.
First: he'd erred in his reaction
Fill him with dissatisfaction,
No more of error and distraction,
Nothing can provide distraction,
But empty fancy's vain distraction
Had long bored Eugene to distraction,
Reminded me of my attraction
While, holding him in such affection,
Refused to give rein to affection;
Is it not so? That girl's affection,
A paragon of pure perfection.
He hardly speaks. In his dejection,
What reply? A harsh rejection.
While he is lost in reflection:
While the last has this reflection:
Then, intrigued by the collection,
At one of whom his recollection
And on the first page, for inspection:
To gaze at will, in her direction,
He rode in his lover's direction;
In your hands, my direction,
Not, blown in every direction,
I beseech your protection...
And though they're filled with contradiction,
Its doomed despite my interdiction,
Blessed, the man who lives a fiction,
An author of romantic fiction
Let him but breathe the passing fiction,
But there's a risk in such fiction,
I've scanned the pages of my fiction,
He was loved...such his conviction,
Abandoning all true discretion,
The bitter-sweet lure of ambition,
Ill-rhymed verse, by tradition,
Three large kibitkas, by tradition.
A scribbled, and mis-spelt, rendition.
Or to ease the world's condition,
Their loads are placed in position;
Lensky's estate, worth a mention,
But in parentheses I'll mention,
Or bow to him, make distant mention,
What of it? Well, my true intention
To challenge him I've no intention
Demanded my full attention.
And at long last claim attention,
Or simply pay him no attention;
Another captured her attention,
A new face claims our attention.
Seizes a book, with rapt attention
Charms us with sublime invention,
Till travel, with its tedious motion,
Who taught her this intense emotion,
Catch the first flush of emotion,
He sees, his heart filled with emotion,
She stands, blushing with emotion,
Tatyana with deep emotion,
Stirred by a solitary emotion;
The house was filled with commotion,
This heartfelt speech, gave the notion,
Each object is, to her notion,
Of pure regret, his only notion
Had called to show their true devotion,
A Lancer, with undying devotion...
Like women, books proved a deception,
All chained to their pre-conception,
Though I'm an adept at description,
To journalists for their consumption
When I was young, a mere suggestion...'
Conveyed a hint, a mere suggestion,
But - could not. She asked a question:
- 'Nurse, now, that's not the question,
Sleep soundly, in oblivion,
O magic night, enchanted moon...
A child's slumber, or the moon,
Nor calls them to their pen at noon.
Indoors the maid will softly croon
Dreams of a country, lost too soon,
Have that to think, and think, upon,
No lorgnettes were trained upon
Byron
Is bare, inevitably bores, the reason:
Herself not certain of the reason)
Plus another hidden reason,
Come, borrow from me, within reason.'
No sentiment to temper reason,
Autumn's gales reveal time's treason,
What can one do in such a season?
But in the late and barren season,
'You could afford a winter season,
Loved Russia in the winter season;
Since she was mad for Richardson.
To his Lovelace, Grandison,
Is certainly no Grandison.
Do you recall your Grandison?'
And the peerless Grandison,
Plates, dishes chime, in unison,
The crushing boredom of bon ton.
As any passing simpleton.
Lest tired of pleasure, freedom won,
And thirty years the prize I earn?
- Thank God - bit by bit, to learn
Sweet as the kiss of love, that's born
Their sentiments were re-born.
An ancient house or one new-born
He darns, old spectacles adorn
Her plight indeed is most forlorn;
Stirs the breeze, brings on the morn,
Do we recall those doomed to burn,
For whom her heart was made to burn,
Poor Lensky! In the grave's far bourn,
Will know the secrets of death's bourn;
Did the singer sadly mourn
Or un-consoled by the return
Can it be true there's no return?
As much the victim of his fun,
To the fields, my friends! Run, run!
Flows in turbid streams that run
The days flashed by - and with the sun
Driven by the springtime sun,
Or in the garden, in the dawn,
Always smiling as the dawn,
He saw as clear as the dawn,
She barely notices the dawn,
Then the shining day will dawn,
As the half-light turns to dawn.
She's paler than the moon at dawn,
Trembling like a hunted fawn.
They'd stroll about on the lawn.
Past the flowers, down the lawn,
The congregation sit and yawn,
Both of them would make him yawn.
He even felt the urge to yawn,
But all eyes were turned, I own,
It's: "I won't." Then on her own
Of someone other, never own
I know, her honour with your own;
Drawn by post-horses, or your own,
And the young city lady, down
At the altar, head bowed down,
Whose kind hand will smooth like down,
The gentle sex is light as down.
And wore, her last defences down,
Vice was ruthlessly put down,
A mob-cap and a quilted gown.
In kerchief and quilted gown,
Worn horns, and a dressing-gown;
Your pride; these feelings shown.
When the light has barely shown,
Friendship like that's to us unknown,
To bee and butterfly unknown.
While virtue won a noble crown.
Soon, beneath the bridal crown,
The ageing laurels of my crown!
The woodland path is overgrown,
For the summer, bored with town,
Deep in the country, far from town,
Opinions they express in town...
And the servants' quarters! No,
And passed the time as people do,
Never spy on what we do,
But what on earth is one to do?
The censors must have work to do.
Left her uncertain what to do...
Whatever he may say or do,
Onegin, without more ado,
The milkmaids from Ochta go
Oblige me. Tell me that you'll go.
But we must to the garden go,
Among the many doomed to go
In yards and fields, loath to go.
Her handkerchief is next to go;
Now, the mazurka. Long ago,
'Tanya!' - 'You know her?' - 'Long ago,
When you were young, long ago,
To a soul that perished long ago;
All that was settled long ago.
From memories of long ago,
Just as at wars of long ago
For I stopped sinning long ago.
As they composed them long ago...'
His son was wed not long ago,'
'She's not in love then?' 'Tell me who!
Stir, as the murmuring swells; for lo,
Defying then the dread Apollo,
Sacred to scions of Apollo,
His lines breathe love alone, and no
- 'You know him then?' - 'Well, yes and no.'
Tell of their conquests, others' too,
Flaxen hair, all gleaming, too,
Farwell to you, my freedom, too!
Farwell to my strange hero, too,
Almanacs; and journals, too,
My liberty, though tedious, too,
Ah, friends! How often joyous, too,
Your Olga, how's Tatyana too?'
Tanya should be married too.
Of noble phrases, moral too,
And Petushkov - spurned him too.
Though late, have the exordium too!
The hero's name I've given too;
(I love such conversation too,
Loved that cold perfection too,
Nodier's Jean Sbogar too.
I liked his face, his manner too,
He is a man of honour too.'
The coolness of the dark glades too,
And I've seen other beauties too
Of all, oblivion; this too,
Jokes and carping comments too,
And fled through the fields, that too
Down he'll slip, and throw you too.
Goes somehow, tomorrow too,
With lines by Baratynsky too,
Danced the mazurka deftly too,
The Moscow belles are many too,
Wilful, wild, but empty too...
A little note then for her hero
Truly? ...Yes, indeed, our hero!
There I too strolled to and fro:
A wreath once swayed to and fro.
Joy of our hours of leisure, so
A host of nymphs around her, so
He's fooled us far too long, and so...'
He yawned inordinately, and so
To suffer at your feet and so
Though the North affects me so.
Her great delight, she loved them so,
Or in some corner, an hour or so,
How long?' - 'Oh, two years or so.' -
That even now can stir us so,
I dare to write about it so,
Sits there as he's accustomed to,
(As their master told them to,
There's no reason for you not to.' -
Offers me her own, in quarto,
What do you say?' - 'Alright!' - 'Bravo!' -
Chapter Two
They were one instead of two.
I'm ready now for chapter two.
With guests, may speak a word or two,
Or frighten with a glance or two
And boxed you ears, a time or two!
By slyly thieving one or two;
The way to turn a verse or two;
To strike a billiard-ball or two,
Still eats and drinks enough for two.
More than once in white night-cap
But Petersburg that restless heap
Has opened up his serving flap.
Drowned in snow, and buried deep.
Benediction we drank deep!
That there's no infamy so deep,
A book, a walk, sleep that's deep,
Visit my humble corner, keep
A dark-eyed, white-skinned maid to keep
Rouse the dull mind from sleep,
Like prisoners released in sleep,
All the world seems lost in sleep,
- 'My little one, you need to sleep.
Is still to lull dark thoughts to sleep.
And my Onegin? Half-asleep
I long to sob, I long to weep...!'
Be careful of your horses step,
Olga's here with tea to sip,
Filling the silences with gossip:
They'll grumble, swap the latest gossip,
Then down Tverskaya Street they bump,
Stalls flash by, and urchins jump,
Of lovely woman, freakish fop.
Heads, in profile, edges crop,
On the divan, a riding-crop.
Lies on the billiard table's top,
As being entre chien et loup,'
Your question ringing in my ear,
Through the wood she flees the bear;
She's followed closely by the bear!
A snowdrift shifts, a shaggy bear,
'Farewell, you valleys, peaceful, dear,
'And she's?' - 'A Larin, and a dear.'
I found an honest plain old dear,
But you, the beautiful, and dear,
Sang youthful joy, and childhood dear,
Oh! Those friends, those friends, so dear,
As yet unknown, I held you dear,
Come in, warm yourself, my dear,
It seems to me I'm ill, my dear,
'You must widen the net, my dear.
But not without a blush, I fear.
The polished table shines, I fear
You too, familiar hills, I fear;
She dare not, in her shame and fear,
That; and perhaps a hidden fear,
She trembles, burning, in fear:
Tanya recovers from her fear,
What consoles them is our fear,
But now my friends I often hear,
Unsuitable for girls to hear),
But Tanya, seeming not to hear,
Is this him, now? She cannot hear.
My husband's folk...do you hear?'
Over waters still and clear,
Two girls, when the moon shone clear,
My soul heard your voice ring clear,
And then, a sudden thought shines clear:
A frosty night: the sky is clear,
Its free flow still dark, unclear.
There the Muse first came near.
The city gates gleam white; they're near;
The creature once again is near;
Tatyana's husband looms near,
'Tell me will your friend appear?'
Roguish, coy, or see appear,
Now night and day he will appear
Those dishes of preserves appear,
To whom the passing forms appear
Sparkles of icy wit appear.
And eighteen nags now appear.
The horses scent the dead, and rear,
Would haunt the grave, and shed a tear.
Will you not stop to shed a tear
To raise a smile, provoke a tear,
Loud farewells, with many a tear;
Turns its leaves, no word or tear;
Glistening, an obedient tear!
Always gave three balls a year
'Then, in that rural wasteland, far
Every day, both near and far;
Sweeter, in night's embrace, by far.
Olga's less alive by far,
Yet brighter shines the moon by far
Doctors, they cry: the best by far,
Friends and enemies from afar
Born, in a garret, of a liar
Pushes the door till it's ajar...
I'll seize a neighbour by the collar,
(Our dear Lomonosov), a grammar,
May yet accustom us to grammar,
The lover too of Rousseau's Julie Womar,
Cottin's Malek-Adhel, de Krudener's de Linar,
Tatyana screams! ...She hears a roar,
Onegin drinks amidst the roar,
The noisy brawl, the banquet's roar,
While nurses screech, and infants roar.
The thundering breakers' mighty roar,
The threatening flames skyward soar.
When will my wings begin to soar?
They bring on the poor child's guitar,
The glittering night holds many a star,
The cock-crow hails the morning star;
Complete with wide-brimmed Bolivar,
When he shows, with the samovar,
The cold ash hides no smouldering ember,
Her spouse the club's most loyal member,
Soon, soon my mind will not remember:
All the British Muse's lumber
Now disturbs a young girl's slumber,
We still tremble, being sober,
And then such things are like a cancer!
Not allow that coarse seducer,
But, what of Onegin? True, dear Reader!
It, lest some sly, caustic reader,
And you, my dear indulgent reader,
And stranger still, behold a spider
In red night-cap, a second rider
The girls' true idol, at least the older
What spirit too! Before we're older,
Her head sinks, the stars grow older,
Eloquence to inspire the bolder,
Her neck, her throat, her shoulder!
Her night-dress slips from her shoulder,
And dark hair hanging to his shoulder.
Who will refrain from slander,
Lo, the company commander,
This hostile climate where I wander,
Who support us when we wander,
So far away her visions wander;
In winter, resting on the fender,
Mocked what true hearts engender;
The homage rank may engender,
That pure emotion youth may render,
The one on Hades' Gate: Surrender
Thoughts and feelings, noble, tender?
His youthful love, warm and tender,
To a love both shy and tender,
They abhor it when we're tender.
Did she pine for him?' She'll wonder;
Laid out in alphabetic order:
The room is loud and growing louder,
Into the pans they sift the powder,
His father had a fine career
And when he wanted to refer
But in the end came to prefer
Take it then, since you're so eager!)
So hear me without tears or anger,
Fleeing at the sign of danger,
To her family a stranger.
All her daily walks grow longer,
'Can you really love the younger?'
'Eugene, I was so much younger,
And then Onegin approached her,
Some girl, delighted that he's found her,
Gazes, painfully, around her;
Oblivious of the world around her,
She weeps. The books surround her,
A clue the index may afford her,
Prince Vyazemsky sat beside her,
If she might return to see her,
The city's sounds swiftly wake her,
Silent, he bows his head before her,
Izmailov's Journal set before her!
I married. And now, you must leave her,
'Yet', he reflects, 'I must save her',
Or from greedy lips, remove her
His first pipings were of her,
Her dream is deeply worrying her,
And finds Tatyana, no one with her;
He'd make conversation with her,
When, betrothed, she had seen her,
Yet now we only see in her
Yet one keen gaze has settled on her,
And pass sarcastic judgement on her.
The women all gathered to her;
This deep and learned opus to her,
The men all bowed deeply to her,
Enters softly and disturbs her,
Still no reply, then he finds her,
Onegin quietly carries her
All that Onegin knew about her...
Their golden crosses, lifted higher.
Here comes Zaretsky, colour higher,
Yet the one whom I set higher,
I pace the shore, wait for fair weather,
He, as friend in need, you'll gather,
On ramrods, and they grate together,
Whispering solemnly together,
When shall I ever loose my tether?
Spins, beats one foot on the other.
By this cruel thirst to kill each other.
Their arms entwined about each other,
Here without an ounce of bother,
Flee the metropolis, its bother,
Both his father and his mother...
Twists her waist one way, another,
Here a village, there another,
He sat down and wrote another,
She was sighing for another,
That somewhere there was another,
There's no response. He writes another;
To hear the tale told by another,
Each had acted like a brother,
They lift the cold body to its bier,
God's servant and a brigadier,
In this same romance, earlier,
The punctilious German baker,
Some new work of the mask-maker,
Childe Harold, bigot, or Quaker,
Necker
Press on! Andryushka, quicker, quicker!
Lowered eyes grown clouded, darker,
And there a seasoned traveller,
Melmoth, Maturin's traveller,
Bored by Theocritus and Homer,
That helped you earn, divine Homer,
And here's Gvozdin, squire and farmer,
Here, with his wife, a portly charmer,
Was for a while her entertainer;
Lacking rosy cheeks, the manner,
And died just before his dinner.
Or after a long tedious dinner,
Dimitry Larin, a poor sinner,
In the graveyard's darkest corner.
It had trapped him, like a mourner
Meanwhile another landowner
She parts then, from the housekeeper,
Yet at dawn the restless sleeper
From the ground floor to the upper,
At last it's over, now it's supper,
'I'm happy, am I not?' he'd whisper.
'Whom does your sweet lyre hold dearer?
And sage of inns, a philanderer;
Semyon Petrovitch, still the miser;
Ivan Petrovich, none the wiser;
He wakes at noon, or even later,
Let me sprinkle you, fetch holy water,
To drive bold tunnels underwater,
She makes him her interpreter,
Far off...the Muse followed after.
Hearing in the crowd, and after,
Reveal my soul, and thereafter
Oh Lord! What can I get you, daughter...
Moscow, Russia's darling daughter,
All the noise of talk and laughter;
Stifling a yawn with laughter:
She'd divert me, or her laughter,
Prompting your malicious laughter?
In silence, plan each other's slaughter.
Bordeaux, I tell the waiter:
Her quiet gaze does not falter.
Pickled mushrooms for the winter,
A parody of southern winter,
Spoilt by each casual encounter,
But the end to this encounter,
And always, in the final chapter,
Part in kindness, giving quarter? ...
Satire's most audacious master,
Inveterate gossip, old-time gangster:
Let me describe her elder sister.
Not a beauty like her sister,
- Why not? - Well, I'd prefer her sister,
Glutton, bribe-taker, and prankster.
To the hands of fashion's monster,
Ignore the tumult and the chatter';
Or we confuse deeds with chatter,
Their incorrect and careless chatter,
He had the gift of easy chatter,
The young man fled their noisy chatter,
He'll have time still for the latter.
From inside there's noise and clatter;
Still add emotion to the matter,
Which to visit first? No matter,
When talk was of some graver matter,
Or we mistake the things that matter;
Their solid grasp of every matter,
His uncle lay at death's door, better
Though blank pages would be better;
Fables: Zadeka though was better;
In fact he soon received a letter
And looked a poet, to the letter,
The seal, I have read your letter.
Enough. It's time for that letter,
She knows she must not see him, ever
He was the practical joker, ever
In romance, the first time ever
Fare thee well!  and if for ever,
But no! - Down the steps, as ever,
His life till dawn the same as ever,
But kept the juiciest stories ever
Alas! Young girls are faithless ever,
O Human Race! Why such a fever
By the nose; deceive the clever;
One that, beyond the grave, never
Neighbours shook their heads, forever
Buoyant as hope, that soars forever;
The holy secret, lost forever,
That she should hate him now forever,
Enters the salon, with a shiver,
Leaving a shining trail, she'd shiver,
Truly! She didn't even shiver,
Dusk falls. The sky is dark. The river
Cast-iron spans will leap the river,
Her eyelids showed not a quiver
Her face grew pale, and she'd quiver.
Though we'd deny its flight, is over.
And dark beneath the branches' cover,
While she gazes at the cover!
Sings all night, wild roses cover
Fell at a friend's hand! You'll discover,
Or more fitting, you'll discover.
And our Katenin moreover
Who pleased her very soul, a lover,
The safest place for a lover
To attract a passing lover.
No more deserving lover,
For him alone, the eternal lover;
How blessed is the modern lover
Reader, alas, that tender lover,
A girl will often change her lover,
Where the nightingale, spring's lover,
Fonvizin shone there, Freedom's lover,
Cattle grazing in the clover,
To sing of life's dry withered flower.
Squandered youth, life's finest flower.
Shall not attack the lily flower,
Nature passages of a power
At eighteen years he had the power,
Whether I fall struck by the power
Cards, or glance, or sweet sigh's power,
I count myself free of its power,
Were it within my power,
And I loved you; ah, what answer,
True, contempt should rightly answer
I fear lest this humble prayer,
But...my mother's tears, her prayer
Meets her calm untroubled air.
When morning breezes filled the air,
Or waste your efforts on the air
But suddenly a draught of air
All life, before us, seemed so fair.
Light as a swallow, and as fair
The gist of some great state affair,
There an old head of scented hair,
Kept the books, and shaved the hair
A branch leans down to snag her hair,
Grip the reins, and from her hair
Sing a song, unbind your hair,
With a hand he smoothes his hair,
Still wept as they unwound my hair,
Places set, each finds a chair,
'By the fireplace, there's his chair,
Rises from his hidden lair,
And sang me to church. What a pair!'
To say her farewells to the pair.
A table's readied for the pair;
And, smiling, room's made for the pair.
The price three-fifty for the pair,
But dinner's served, the couples pair,
You'll not find three lovely pair.
Lord Byron with a shrewd despair,
Ah, they made me long despair
To our dance, to our choir.
Tatyana hears their distant choir,
Says yes and no, but never sir
His neighbour, caused an equal stir,
A priceless treasure, here to stir
Olga was the first to stir
Though young he learnt the way to stir
Where you too were nourished or
And as for trouble...well, I'm done for,
And why? What am I striving for?
'What do I haunt the ballet for?
A street-light, though inferior.
'The man's a lunatic, a boor,
That Tanya can reach the door.
She finds a spy-hole in the door,
All rise; he rushes to the door.
The sledge is waiting, at the door,
He turns to go, and at the door,
The clock strikes ten. He's at the door;
Guests bow politely at the door,
Glancing stealthily at the door.
In shirt and night-cap, by the door;
A ballroom tyrant by the door
He pushes through the open door,
Follows her from door to door,
Taunting the watch at midnight's door;
Triquet's slumbering on the floor,
The chairs scrape backwards on the floor,
And sets her down upon the floor.
Verse sounds, as he strides the floor,
Clatters his chair against the floor;
Or on the ballroom's gleaming floor,
My heart sinks now, in shame and terror...
Even in the midst of terror.
To read in Russian. Ah, what horror!
This ruthless critic, legislator,
Yet to my stomach it's a traitor,
The artiste's flatterer and traitor,
Some tell-tale, or vile inventor
Or her breast, filled with languor;
Eyes downcast, till her languor,
Or madam' so they all concur.
Where French sounds were de rigeur,
Chapter Four
Then plunged into domestic labour.
After such unremitting labour,
But they're replete from their labour,
Cannot quite eclipse her neighbour.
'How is she then, your fair neighbour,
With God knows who for neighbour,
Neighbour wheezes now at neighbour.
Like Childe Harold, mournful, dour,
Cold, darkly threatening, and dour!
'To me Onegin all this splendour
In days of dream and ardour,
Did I so long with painful ardour
Telling the story of his ardour,
So, enjoy the fleeting hour
Sleep and waking have their hour,
Than the insults of this hour,
The bud of life's fairest hour,
Eight years he killed, hour by hour,
My husband's wound, his valour,
His face, the princess, in the parlour,
Of beauties, with the press's clamour,
Of our world grant me honour;
Boldly trusting in your honour...'
Like bees that leave the hive, and pour
Is ever-jealous, sullen, sour,
- 'Just a little more, a flavour...
Werther, born to be a martyr,
Love is a mere game of Satan's.
Of an old uncle, or some father's,
My love for you is as a brother's,
Had to present his hero as
Each man to his own ideas,
Pour out complaints, confessions, pleas,
How I longed to be those seas
Beneath his cherries and acacias,
Calashes, broughams, and kibitkas.
With coaches, carriages and britzkas,
Just like those Van Dyck Madonnas,
Through its pages swiftly combs,
Politely mentioning various topics,
Buyanov, my lively 'cousin' leads
(Those Memoirs), and two Petriads
Will be improved to take such loads:
A mere five hundred years) our roads
She rushes to the open fields,
And to deep emotion yields:
Poised above the letter's folds.
Sits with head downcast, still holds
Our fates lay in Fortune's hands.
Sang of all the far-off lands
To feast our eyes on foreign lands,
Where on quiet desert strands,
Yet all too soon the summer ends,
Might have been turned to better ends -
The hill slope and where it ends
Know its worth, and how it ends.
So scarcely breathing, she descends
And speaks to them, as to old friends.
To see Onegin dead, my friends.
Of this fickle life, my friends!
Seeking the pleasure of my friends
Which translates as: he intends
Onegin smiles as he extends
Where in cold blood opposing broods,
Of dances, poetry, and cards,
Her Grandison, adept at cards,
Glide smoothly over lacquered boards,
A dandy, ensign in the Guards.
All is still, only the guards
Sleighs and shacks and boulevards,
Fashionable shops, and yards,
Despite the lack of streets and yards,
Call to each other in the yards,
Though a provincial town affords
On nightmare, like those ancient feuds
'My Grandison? ...Oh, Grandison! Yes!
All that I knew forgotten. Yes,
Now, no more, of ifs and maybes,
Sees it all; the fashions, faces,
The parlour's full of unknown faces,
There was a time when envious faces
Pinched her waist with tight laces,
He notes the boxes, serried places,
Used the nasal 'n' in places
An ace of clubs at twenty paces,
Their daughters offer their embraces,
Lap dogs yapping, airs and graces,
They, dear Moscow's living graces,
Possess that cunning, share those vices,
Be amused by our vices;
Know all love's treacherous devices!
Raises his pistol slowly, glances;
What languor's in her magic glances!...
In those soft seductive glances!
From the first she craved romances,
She reads the sweet romances,
Whatever chapter most entrances,
With what heavenly grace, advances,
Never scorned the world's advances,
Yevgeny, silently advances,
To our hero, who concedes
Tired of repeating platitudes,
Before he's drained life to the lees,
Crawling to him on her knees,
To long to fall there, clasp your knees,
A village, a house among the trees,
Surrounded by its ancient trees
Then from the heights she sees
Ringed by loyal devotees,
The prejudices of the ages,
(Fancies, fables of the ages,
Featherbeds, cockerels in cages,
The secrets of the grave, the pages
Skipping over certain pages,
Letters running to six pages,
Who's not exhausted by their rages,
Then the servant's noise presages
Of Moldavia's gloomy reaches;
Its feasts forgotten and its speeches,
Blessing Russia's ruts and ditches
Made by sorcerers and witches.
Here's a hut, to which he dashes,
Now along the track he crashes,
An embittered mind that seethes
Who never harboured foolish fancies,
As conversation slowly dies,
To little feet, entrancing ladies.
Not for long were lovely ladies
Not knowing what it signifies,
Sailing the untroubled skies,
Where cupolas raise to glowing skies
But no, beneath Finland's skies,
Under Goethe's, Schiller's skies,
Beguiles, with its seductive lies.
Yet now they're near. Before them lies
With her carpet, billowing where it lies,
Along the streets where snow-melt lies,
So be it! My fate now lies
Where his honoured dust now lies
'Here, young Vladimir Lensky lies,
And one bright morning, off he flies,
Scattering herself abroad, she flies,
Wakes, and to the house she flies.
The door swings open, wide it flies,
'Dear, you can't be well,' replies,
And awkwardness, barely replies,
That fashion or luxury supplies,
And now, recalls past enemies,
Kitchen-gardens, balconies,
Farewell, lonely sanctuaries.'
Her cheek rests on her hand, she cries,
'Ah, at last!' their hostess cries,
'Is this forever', sadly cries
Lamp-posts, mansions, monasteries,
To sighs, or praise, or flatteries.
Their hopes, their pranks, their reveries;
Childhood mischief, petty glories
Proud, in its glorious memories,
Were not her forte; horror stories
Pelt him, with ripe red cherries,
Embellished by their jealousies.
For a noisy world of vanities...
Old companions' cruelties;
How well she carries out the duties
Scream rings out...the cabin shakes...
St Chariton's, the carriage brakes;
This whole exhausting journey takes
And Tanya, full of terror, wakes...!
Here's an end to all their jokes -
And in spring, in hidden vales,
Ancestral portraits stretched for miles,
Stoves shone with ceramic tiles.
You were the first, capricious belles,
Not now: we like more polished games,
Agitates the candle-flames;
The windows rattle in their frames.
Lines more worthy of such themes,
Such as they are, view these extremes
Where is the storm of love's extremes,
Then tea arrives. Not by the chimes
As for Tanya this one chimes:
For whom, to expiate our crimes,
In these far less tender times.
Have played a rubber; and eight times
Land of bewitchment! In past times
The blare of music, and the fumes
While the girls recite old rhymes,
And Knyazhnin's imitative rhymes.
We've no use for Parny's rhymes
We wrote all those secret rhymes,
Meet the sky in sombre lines,
Here's a wood: in beauty, pines
Come away, my pretty ones,
Quietly flows. The beetle drones.
From the field, with hushed tones.
While we, of Hymen's charms the foes,
Wigs and scarlet-heeled shoes.
The shepherd, weaving his bast shoes,
She lies for hours, while sleep escapes
Behind the strange bed's silken drapes,
Strange broken music of the steppes...
At dark fields, mirroring her cares.
Triquet, ingenious poet, dares,
Sleepless, at the window, stares
Its subtle beauty lights the fires
No, never in the fiercest fires
Of all the authors she admires,
To shelter lovers' trysts aspires;
Sweet conversation that inspires,
You'll learn its bliss, its desires,
Of tortured youth and its desires
Of a swarm of sweet desires.
I've found all that a poet desires,
Would join the literary bores,
Without doubt, Eugene adores
On earth but you my heart adores!
Askance his opera-glass now centres
Even as man of honour, features:
We all possess Napoleon's features;
The millions of two-legged creatures
So our age improves us creatures!
All those foreign words and phrases.
The one she fears and idolises -
Our poor Tatyana recognises,
There the Petrovsky palace rises,
Steel combs, files in various guises,
La morale est dans la nature des choses.
Frost already, frozen noses,
(My Reader thinks the rhyme is roses:
Like the sins that youth rehearses,
Is there a poet who rehearses
Some wild past your heart rehearses,
In this casual set of verses:
Or Bogdan�vich's light verses.
For his love, his latest verses?
In a red peruke and glasses,
Up through the flue, sparkling glasses
The hearth glows, pipe-smoke passes,
(With Panil Kharlikov, who passes,
Then Onegin swiftly dresses,
Proud beauties' in their flimsy dresses,
In her mind she writes, addresses.
Orders Guillot, since time presses,
The balcony, whose throng oppresses,
She sighs and in herself possesses
How? From that wilderness...' He uses,
'Surely it's not' - Yevgeny muses -
Along the rows of darkened houses,
Down the streets where evening drowses,
Toying happily with the Fates.
Dealt you by the cruel Fates?
The merry lads cut with their skates,
All he sees and hears, he notes;
To Olga, his hours he devotes;
'Qu'�crirez-vous sur ces tablettes?'
One foot planted, pirouettes
Receive my thanks, and grateful dues,
Abandoned for barbaric tongues,
Spring clothes the branches with new leaves,
Not all will see what your soul weaves,
With vain ideas the brain conceives.
Despite the pallor languor gives,
Whose serfs live miserable lives;
Was dross enough for many lives.
To his stand the cabman drives,
Pustyakov the plump arrives,
They dine out at the relatives
While the babble of their wives,
Of our prophetic meeting: yes,
Then father blessed me, and said yes.
At the gate, says her goodbyes,
Tatyana, with tear-stained eyes.
Of raucous laughter swell; all eyes,
On the stone, with his own eyes
A haze of tears to cloud her eyes.
She shudders, silent, yet her eyes
Forbidden fruit before our eyes,
The human harvest to our eyes,
And halts: what's this, before his eyes?
Lensky can't believe his eyes.
They the masters, to his eyes.
When Zaretsky met his eyes.
Turns on the stage indifferent eyes,
The opponents wait, with downcast eyes.
The tears flow from my eyes,
Again imagination blazes,
Again, a simple touch amazes,
For here, elated by the prizes
Brushes of thirty different sizes,
Morality is in the nature of things.
My youth fled by, enchantment clings.
You fritter away your evenings?'
Of wisdom, then for coffee rings,
Aurora, rosy-fingered, brings
Blessed our first poor offerings;
Like Byron, who of Gulnare sings,
Tanya's birthday, filled with greetings,
Where, in the shadow of the wings,
Those first successes gave us wings;
The language of the gods, her songs
Secret rendezvous in sleighs;
They're harnessed to the master's sleighs,
'I am in love' Tatyana sighs,
With the man of honour, and sighs;
Queen of mysteries and sighs.
'They're all past they're best' he sighs;
Far now from praise, he sighs,
His epitaph discreetly sighs:
Under the oak-trees' sheltering boughs,
How changed now our Tatyana is!
Were ever dearest friends of his,
Seeks Olga's lovely hand in his;
Tanya's the centre of all this.
Your perfection in all this;
In a time far, far from this,
What in the world is worse than this,
Ourselves the integer in this.
Petushkov, neighbourhood Adonis,
But through some process of osmosis,
Magnetism or hypnosis,
- The duellists remove their cloaks,
The roses of her burning cheeks,
The frost glitters. We give thanks,
Welcome with joy the winter's pranks.
And question-marks in several books.
For a swift interchange of looks,
Comparing notes, like circling sharks,
Fashionable Record Office clerks,
Her to that hellish crew - and peals
Eugene flings wide the door, reveals
Folksongs, and the wedding chorals,
That there existed chosen vessels,
To her village, despite its hovels,
Her garden, her romantic novels,
Should disregard the subject of his nails;
Where the swan in beauty sails,
Custom is a tyrant, and prevails.
To mend Europe's dainty coils,
Meanwhile the village Cyclops toils,
And in his silent room recalls,
Whitening the oak boughs, and fills
Olga's there, and quietly fills
The meadows and the slopes of hills;
The shining tea-cups, never spills
Oil-lamps bright on window sills,
A flow of silhouetted stills,
Its rich sonorous cadence rolls.
Will slyly whisper, grinning fools...'
Emotion's only fit for fools.
Are only instruments and tools;
All spiteful gossip, yet his tools
Twice a year, loved Christmas carols,
Night falls, and the moon patrols
Uncomfortable, unsmiling pearls;
With friendship's and wisdom's pearls,
Such albums of provincial girls,
And a host of younger girls,
I know: they'd like to force our girls
Could you conceive those golden curls,
The sumptuous mansion gleams,
Brighter than finest parquet gleams
Alone, where the meadow gleams
On the girl's pale beauty gleams,
In the silvery moonlight, dreams,
Reflecting you, your noble dreams,
And you, the bright celestial dreams,
Oh, be spared these fearful dreams,
He sweetened with delightful dreams
You appeared to me in dreams,
But wonders come to her in dreams:
Meanwhile, the sad moon dreams,
Believes completely in her dreams?
Verses, quarrels: ah, what dreams!
Sometimes in my fondest dreams
They yet can thrill me in my dreams.
What laughter from enchanted streams,
The ice that paves the hidden streams,
While behind the window streams
With some dangerous volume roams,
Not even plain idiocy redeems,
A puzzle that seduced, it seems.
Stirred by a stranger's glance, it seems,
Relations then are those, it seems,
Wrapped in mist and gloom, it seems
Because her simplicity, it seems,
I still remember, and it seems
The little foot I touch it seems;
Their empty world, or so it seems.
She graces the Assembly Rooms:
Welcome her with open arms,
With exclamations at her charms,
Chairs, chests, and watering-cans,
Out clearly what relation means.
Of wild geese, in noisy clans,
Jars of jam, and frying-pans,
Southward stretch the caravans
Come you maidens, pretty maidens,
Propped on her elbow, now she pens,
Among them all, confusion reigns,
Tatyana the pale garden gains,
Seeking miracles, for his pains.
Over it he'd rack his brains,
The glittering stars, their endless trains,
While drowned by frantic violins
The jealous ladies whisper sins.
Morals makes us nod, not sins;
And even there, at last, vice wins.
Having escaped those stormy regions
Driven by its laws and fashions,
His tributes, carefully, he fashions.
Those high aims ambition fashions,
Indifferent to its thoughts and passions.
But most of all they talked of passions,
Where now are the burning passions,
Full of life's sincerest passions,
Yevgeny took, in dreamy sessions,
Alone amongst his new possessions,
Are subject to infatuations,
Hearing the same outworn objections,
Administering the same corrections
Why now pay me these attentions?
Because, rich, noble, the conventions
Ducked the moralizing sermons,
Spared the lad from weary lessons,
A mirror on the moon, but learns
It stifles her...her spirit yearns
And, heedless of the cold, she turns
For rural life, and memory turns
Within its glow no interest dawns,
Then he turns away - and yawns,
Now a provincial girl, she steps;
Triquet; Buyanov then steps
Faithfully follow in your footsteps;
Your slightest glance; your smiling lips;
For Eugene, falls from her lips,
While a soft smile adorns her lips.
Habitually, between their lips.
To kiss the young Armida's lips,
A foreign tongue it is that slips,
Past the bridge, and pond, she stops,
Fresh linen: take time by the ears;
Pluck the gold earrings from her ears;
But still the pounding in her ears,
He with lawyers round his ears,
He hated girls' neurotic fears;
In exchange, her hopes and fears;
Threats, entreaties, vows and fears,
But Tatyana, scarcely hears
The two friends' greeting scarcely hears,
Then as the rural evening nears,
Guillot, his French valet, appears;
Early, the will to rule appears,
All in our sage's cell appears
Yet he stays; readier, it appears
Her. Galloping, closer it appears.
He waits then Lensky appears,
And then one wet shoe disappears
Hysteria, fainting, tragic tears,
Deceit, and slander, rings and tears,
I'm grieving still, but free of tears,
Her eyes are clouded, filled with tears,
While her eyes are drowned in tears.
Though she's unmoved by it, no tears
Your passion, letters and your tears.
Then you would weep, yet your tears,
Passion's death-march brings tears:
Won tributes of spontaneous tears,
At the turning of the years,
What thorns, not roses, through the years
Our philosopher of eighteen years.
For my dreams, my tender years
For social worlds beyond her years,
The storm that shook my soul for years
Our troikas fit to run for years,
Ozerov's tragedies for years
A single boat with outspread oars
Among the snowdrifts, roars
Lions on gates, with frozen roars,
A distant strand of singing soars;
Years long gone, now faded embers?
Perhaps the troubled soul remembers
My pen I find no longer wanders,
Her soul in distant regions wanders,
'Nurse, go now.' She swiftly ponders:
So lively are our charioteers,
I write, my heart no longer suffers,
Or with a burning hand touch hers,
You fortunate philosophers,
It's time, you inveterate idlers,
To make an end, than take the waters;
(Such is the sex, all Eve's daughters);
Vast applause. Onegin enters,
To torment fashionable rhymesters,
Abodes of demons and of monsters;
The wary traveller first shivers,
On the highway, snorts and quivers;
His days and dreams, what man recovers?
The breathless meeting of young lovers;
Settee and table, chests of drawers,
I'd still wander those bright bowers.
Malicious cowards, slanderous players,
A swarm of beauties, cool betrayers;
Printed among the ancient airs,
And Flyanov, toss and turn on chairs,
In the dining room downstairs;
Wanders among forest choirs
Onegin, shut himself indoors,
That simple stall, with oaken floors
On her shoulders, adjust the furs,
In this countryside of ours,
For what we see, not what is ours?
Now he rested from his labours,
Calling Moscow to its labours;
No fields prove to be her neighbours,
And was wept for by his neighbours,
Of clock or watch I count the hours,
I've wasted far too many hours,
The foolish horizon honours.'
A seething torrent, foaming, pours
Drawn to the tree, and what sours,
That heartless icy look of yours,
It's Heaven's will: I am yours.
When through the thanksgiving Mass,
No connoisseur with opera glass,
Nothing from that darkened glass,
She - always she, behind the glass...!
The twilit view beyond the glass,
His own features in the glass;
In the water's smooth still glass,
My disenchanted opera-glass,
Turning on the alien mass
Seeing its sad face tremble, pass...
The husband was the first to pass
From loge or parterre, saw her pass.
There they sit, the minutes pass,
And a house - where shadows pass,
So youth's happiness must pass,
Cast-iron statue which they pass,
To see, unwillingly, as they pass,
Foot it sweetly, on the grass!
Brief as your footprints on the grass.
Like fresh air they loved their kvass,
But the cold, aloof Princess,
Surrender's language, rare excess?
She seems the image, to excess,
It's peppered with them to excess,
The unapproachable goddess,
Who in your verse is your goddess?
I love their little feet, confess
No Russian terms exist, confess,
And I -with a sigh, I confess -
Strength to complain, I confess,
Though, dear Reader, I confess
Time's done it's work, I must confess,
So people (I openly confess)
I now enjoy composing less.
He scrapped the old corv�e, no less,
Of your perfection too, no less
A pedant in the details, no less.
To persuade my parents, no less,
There lives, and thrives no less,
At home all day, more or less,
His generous spirit still could bless
One day, to illuminate and bless
Old, Tanya, and my mind...God bless,
Now, while predictable and mindless
Onegin slumbers on regardless.
Wheeling in its circles, tireless
Even their slanders meaningless,
All is so pale and colourless,
Worse, with a joyless madness
The soul, wreathed in its sadness;
Old age is pain and wretchedness...'
And yet with a pretended coldness
Flowers, love, fields, and idleness,
Yields to pensive idleness,
Curses their hours of idleness,
Make friends, from sheer idleness.
Epigram in all its coarseness,
As it is, I ask forgiveness,
So be it! Neutral nothingness
Though he can't bring me happiness.'
It's all too much such happiness,
With such ephemeral happiness,
'I was not born for happiness,
Were substitutes for happiness.
And portrayed love's happiness,
No breath at all of haughtiness,
On a rich pie (its saltiness,
Echoing in its emptiness:
The sun now dispels the darkness,
The eye to hides its joyfulness...!
No absurdity, no foulness,
It's time to leave. Feigning calmness,
A prophet in the wilderness,
In the intellectual wilderness,
His fleeting glance of tenderness;
Who inspired such tenderness,
That folly, that past tenderness.
She loves in all seriousness,
And carpeted voluptuousness.
Full of innocence and sweetness.
Rewards with its fond caress
A future world with their caress.
At the same hour's sweet caress,
Or a young girl's shy caress.
And as for our young votaress,
By candle-light she'd rise and dress.
The girls in fashionable dress,
The princess, in a simple dress,
Meanwhile in his morning dress
The gleam of wit and silken dress,
Or kiss the hem of her dress.
Was a very dandy in his dress,
Our hero's previous address.
Peacefully their lives progress,
Falls silent. Only heir, heiress,
Nor did her troubled lips compress.
All those torments that oppress,
He'd dare to toy with a tress,
Pleased as I always am to stress,
Turn pale, or blush with distress,
Pale, alone, and in distress;
To make of that; her own distress;
In noting Tanya's distress,
Was it for you all that distress?
Champagne is like a mistress,
A lady approaches the hostess,
Lest the world, her spouse, should guess
- 'Nurse, how slow you are to guess!' -
Alas, not difficult to guess!
Where is he, now?' 'You'll never guess,
On the table, bubble, hiss,
And calms his fears with a kiss,
Mourning her husband's absent kiss,
With warmth a comrade's manly kiss,
But you, the men in wedded bliss,
Anticipating future bliss.
Uttered in those days of bliss,
Never doubting, lived in bliss.
Grow paler, and then die....what bliss!
Beneath the table's damask gloss,
In the springtime on the moss,
He trots, performs amazing feats,
On his sledge the yard-boy seats
Military dandies, diplomats,
Past the ranked aristocrats,
Went to pay his fond respects,
What if your pistol-shot inflicts
Whose rash look or sneer conflicts
'You're off again? Oh, these poets!'
Takes a leap and, like down, sets
Her work the crackling firewood lights,
Indifferent to wintry delights;
And to those seductive nights,
Breathing the frosted air of nights;
The faithful friend of wintry nights.
Such were my Yevgeny's thoughts.
Is this the destiny that waits,
Cossacks, Bokharans, merchants,
Raspberries, sweet redcurrants:
Pharmacies, towers, and peasants,
Nomadic tribes in humble tents;
By a pillar, between two aunts,
Maid of riper years, accepts
By critics of the higher arts,
Grateful, in my heart of hearts,
Of follies fit to test the courts,
Arrive to laughter, schoolboy jests,
The dead man buried priest and guests
Tales from their past. The guests
Where now, exchanging looks, the guests
The presentation of the guests
She pays no attention to their guests
Sometimes they receive as guests,
Hopes she'll warm, if he insists,
But he is stubborn and persists,
Why did you come, to disturb us?
Unbearable to see before us
But from our friends, may God preserve us!
Into verse that would amaze us,
Where could be better? - Where there are none of us!
'It seems he has forgotten us!'
To roam the forests green, so us,
And all their echoes false to us,
When we see him, when he's near us,
Follow the bland crowd that bores us,
- 'You're right, and so you'd show us,
Who is never bored by us?
I'd not have known you, and thus
That slept beneath her pillow thus.
Through our work, of lost genius:
Off as if blown by Aeolus,
In silent joy, of night's bounteous
Of a living work, as dubious
Like Horace, peaceful and sagacious,
(A feeling tortuous and tenacious:
A trouble-maker, and malicious;
Once scorned by the malicious,
Or that the stupid are malicious;
Sparkling, lively, and capricious,
Rewarding the merely meretricious;
As affected, strange and vicious,
Since that old duellist is vicious,
Their laughter noisy, tedious,
Besides they are so pure, so pious,
Istomina stands, serious
Asks Larina, curious,
He was pursued by a vexatious
So charming and so perilous?
Scorn Moscow? Is the world so marvellous?
Their raucous games so frivolous.
Their violence seems ridiculous
(Both are perhaps synonymous)
She was a girl, she was amorous.
He thought them quite innocuous,
So inflexible, so virtuous,
O rus!
And church-crosses black with daws.
Subject now to passion's laws;
Nor foreign beauties, foreign views,
And listen to the forest news,
Golden cornfields, flowery meadows,
Parkland, overgrown, soft shadows
A bottle pops; the wine now flows
As verse inside him burns and glows,
She plunges on, he grunts and follows,
Far into the silent hollows;
Misty climes, and vague tomorrows,
He sang of parting and of sorrows,
They exchanged their childish vows,
My heart is with the good old days.
Shorter and shorter grow the days,
The simple lore of bygone days;
'Tanya! What a notion! In those days,
To fill up my declining days.
Were changing with the passing days.
In those old Lyceum days,
Oh, farewell now, the golden days!
The journey took them seven days.
She sees him clear; and other days
Ceased to count the summer days,
The one she wore in former days;
In the morning of our days.
Sleeps soundly, passes thus his days,
But even in her earliest days
I once spent my sweetest days?
And where he spent those icy days,
But only, it seems, from my days
The glittering frost on shiny days;
The delights of frosty days,
That's my favourite, nowadays.
The tedious halts that, with delays,
A casual guest comes, sits and plays,
As lightning in his visage plays.
On a steep slope, in the sun's rays,
Lightly, he falls. His gaze betrays
To deviate from established ways
Write novels in established ways
Sad rustling fills the woodland ways,
Pleasure in a thousand ways,
In happiness, in idle ways,
With its hissing, foaming ways;
Of simple speech and rural ways
They keep to their habitual ways:
And my mother-in-law, bless her ways,
Glad now that his former ways
He gently yielded to its ways,
All mankind's malicious ways
As for me....they're not my ways,
He sought the forest's shadowy ways,
The load on each kibitka sways,
To offer up the Kremlin keys.
But gaze at him, as she surveys...
Blinded, dazed by sombre joys,
You'll drink the poison love employs,
Bottles of Cliquot or Mo�t,
He breathes the air of freedom, at
The ballet's beat he should be at.
Seems half a heron, half a cat!
Strange presentiments: even the cat
Ten times, and never miss a beat;
The crush, the stir there, and the heat.
Glass on glass to drench the heat
A pulse, the blood's living heat,
As his watch's chimes repeat
That a friend would not repeat,
And ignominiously repeat
The honour paid it is not great;
As though we can never treat
In whatever way words can entreat -
Of that last cutlet's fiery fat,
Wide gloomy brow and bicorn hat.
An instant hails the entrechat,
A dwarf who sports a tail; and that,
(Likenesses too, of this and that)
Warning her of this and that,
A bit of this a bit of that,
Napoleon, arms crossed, with that
Jugs of cranberry juice, all that
I can't go out: my legs they're what
You must go, no matter what.' -
Zaretsky establishes what's what
And we can all display �clat,
Then grasped the instant by the throat,
And ruled him like an autocrat.
Custom demands. They sat and sat,
Enchanted me: I often sat
From the stove on which it sat.
With that secret, gave her dictat,
And gladly lived a life of debt
And there you'll see, without a doubt,
She hesitates, is filled with doubt:
Exhaust him, now, let him doubt,
And prettier then, too, no doubt,
Issued from your heart's redoubt?
Have had sufficient time to act
Now estimates we need, in fact,
So blameless in their intellect,
Who showed him ambiguous respect.
So clever, and so circumspect,
From foes we can ourselves protect:
A great fat goose her red-webbed feet
Sketching women's legs and feet,
Threads the rows among the feet,
In wild repentance at her feet
And seething abyss at her feet
The groves and meadows at her feet,
Yet prove as faithless....as their feet.
In pain and sorrow, at your feet,
Touching the earth with her light feet,
Why now? What brings you to my feet?
My mind....But you're pale as a sheet:
Of candlelight, the dancers fleet,
Seeking their charms she goes to meet
Or far sounds rise, as wheels meet
The cobbles of Milyona Street.
Their words, their looks, both are sweet,
Had opened... 'Yet the death is sweet
Don't be cross with me, my sweet,
What languor fills her breast, my sweet!
That moment - how should we forget? -
Youth slipped by, years to forget,
You bear no blame. I can't forget,
Her former room she can't forget.
Madman, could your heart forget?
The general, flattered by the diet
Or in solitude, and quiet;
Young girls, hurrying, fell quiet;
First rouse his vanity and let
He sought them without joy, and met
There in the garden, where we met,
Onegin's friendship, so they met.
And died with all he owed unmet.
To mesh him deeper in our net.
An Academician in a bonnet!
There's Princess Helena's tulle bonnet,
Pronouncing: 'He was a poet!'
Echoing down the years. The poet
In chilled bottles, for the poet,
Or alternatively the poet
Like Byron, pride's perfect poet,
Is it not true, my fellow poet,
On the granite parapet,
His heart consumed with regret
Their loss, without pain or regret,
For careless youth's without regret,
Display their vests, or form a set,
To his rivals, that whole set,
On what spring flowers are you set?
Tatyana feels half-dead; Triquet,
The Tambov wit, Monsieur Triquet,
Tanya with gratitude, and yet
Had vanished long ago, and yet
Not she? It is though...no...and yet...
Yields to it like a child, as yet
And life's horizons broad as yet,
To bear the marriage-yoke as yet,
Might have climbed Parnassus yet
Can this girl who's scarcely yet
Lecturing me, so fiercely...yet,
Eugene, now Vladimir had left,
Her prudent husband, swiftly left
For his estate, where she, bereft,
By Olga, though yet not bereft
Chapter Eight
Doubt is over, they will fight,
Had merely challenged him to fight.
Incite two friends of his to fight,
The desk with its shaded light,
A wintry carpet deep and light,
And I - perhaps, far from the light,
Be more amused by something light.
Rising with the morning light,
Restless till the morning light.
A duel in the morning light,
Now from the shed at morning light
And the moon's celestial light,
Shines above, its tranquil light
The roads are smooth, the burden light.
'Ah, but the elegy's so light,
Or must my dull gaze fail to light
He read, by an inner light,
In coaches, burdensome or light,
Alone, in silence. The moon sheds light.
Gazing on the moon, its light,
With that pale diaphanous light,
She gazes round; the room grows light;
Beside the mill, and at first light,
If I were certain at first light,
Soon the dawn will bring new light,
And leaves them in the gloomy light
His mare snorts at the snowy light,
His virulence, his scorn, alight
The Muse set my world alight,
Travel's easy, a delight;
He was her solace and delight,
His labour, torment and delight,
The soul with torment and delight;
The child of luxury and delight.
Lends it charm, intense delight.
Winter! ...The peasant with delight
They say there's no sweeter delight
Now jealousy shows its delight!
They'd welcome you with great delight.'
Were what gave her most delight,
Schiller, to scan by candlelight.
Crossed her path, in panicked flight,
Her way again in soulful flight?
Then dashes off uphill, in flight.
Lift her trailing hem, in flight;
Truth to tell, his knowledge slight,
Treads the skies.' Well now, I might
To read an epigraph, and might
Blessed is he...although she might
He'd feared lest his opponent might
I could endure until the night.
In all her beauty, in the night.
She'd lead me in the dead of night,
She'd dream of him at dead of night,
Solitude, silence, dark of night,
In winter when the shades of night
And turning morning into night
Than that for poet, day or night.
How often, on a summer's night,
Till January the third, at night,
Told in winter, late at night.
You too, sweet girls, who late at night,
Drives home again, where that night
Deep, in the translucent night
A simple Russian scene, by night,
Sharing her pillow every night.
To sleep later. Now goodnight.'
'No.' - 'With pleasure.' - 'When?' - 'Tonight.
Never placed him in the right,
I imagine (say, if I'm right):
Where are you, now? It's your right,
In as brief a cartel as was right,
He seems to see his Olga, bright
The dawn is breaking, crimson, bright,
Her sad eyes tearful and bright,
To bring, with love and solace bright,
'The morning star will tremble bright,
'Whoever's love for you's more bright,
His springtime occupation bright,
The moon no longer shines as bright,
Then my student cell was bright
Silently: the dawn was bright,
Silvering loosened hair, tears bright,
To hear the Nereids' whispers bright,
In her confusion she'd take fright,
No time to retrieve it, in her fright,
The speeding cabs whirl out of sight
The wild host vanishes from sight,
Between the lines that met his sight,
Then replaced, their case shut tight;
Frantic and quivering, caught
Friend or foe, it matters naught,
Good and evil, what science taught,
He who feels, is quickly taught
We've toppled Lovelace as we ought,
A prize which Tatyana bought
Ardent and eccentric thought,
Sharing pleasures, meals, and thought.
Young poet of meditative thought,
Sparked a deeper train of thought,
He who's lived, he who's thought
A wandering pedlar had brought
Now hostility had brought
From misty Germany he brought
This the message your note brought?
Whatever the future might have brought,
And the shame dishonour brought,
Looks about her...fate has brought
Farewell. Whatever it was you sought,
Such am I. Was it this you sought,
A monstrous crew, imagine it!
So unlooked-for, I'll not give it,
Lack the strength just now to live it,
And never breathe a word of it,
And pierce the very heart of it.
My friends, where's the sense in it?
By the entrance step, or on it,
Who'll solemnly consider it,
'I'll not keep you, but where is it,
'I don't see what's so bad about it.'
Even though he cannot know it,
Those dear creatures, oh, you know it,
Its violent storms, are blessed by it,
That I have here daubed my portrait,
The carriage horses, chilly, wait,
Yet so be it: here I wait:
In your thoughts, you would wait,
With sad expectancy would wait
Two bullets - nothing else - await
A tedious season we await,
But none of them have changed a bit,
A fresh demon will inhabit
Praised his sheer daring; he could hit
To love the ages must submit;
Their tendency to sit, and sit.
And, there? .....Around a table sit
Hates the tedium of their visit,
'I hate the fashionable circuit,
Bringing flowers, and ripening fruit.
I know I'm slow, and short of wit,
And argue whether it shows wit.
Upon it, sadly, Tanya leant,
A tenderness. Whether he meant
All that you sincerely meant
Like him her dress was elegant.
Alas, now some are distant,
Not looking backward for an instant,
Slippers, dressing-gown: this instant;
Hastily he rings; the servant,
He gave his arm: downcast, head bent,
At heart a simple innocent,
To all this; yet, an innocent,
Yet were they wholly innocent
Not even a joke half-innocent,
From the fog, the horse can scent
Or tortured vanity, dark, quiescent,
Those feelings, so long quiescent;
Marriageable girls there, in a crescent,
Not even just by accident,
Applies himself with diligent
Limburger cheese, soft and pungent,
To whom hope her brightness lent,
Where, above shadowy waters blent,
Abandoned, the fields are silent,
She, more pallid, and more silent!
At first I wished to stay quite silent,
Who mingled with some pure lament,
Midst oft repeated amusement?
Alas, on every stray amusement
Or stir her soul, no incitement.
Some subtle whispered compliment,
That's no ready compliment,
(And philosophic sentiment
When progress and enlightenment
To see what fresh enlightenment,
From porch to yard, in a moment,
And never bothered for a moment
At the least unguarded moment.
And now, at this very moment,
Lensky, blazing with resentment,
There stands a simple monument.
Yet built an eternal monument,
And substituted light quit-rent,
At home he renders it apparent
At first they seemed indifferent
Habit joy's surrogate, heaven sent.
Is it not you, this heaven-sent
In his face? Why is he present?
Muddling the wits of all those present.
They wed her, without her consent.
I'll requite, with your assent:
Presses her hand - his whole intent
Half-jesting, or with true intent;
Prose and poetry, in intent.
Trembling too, with her intent,
The serfs applauded his intent.
If I'd reserved a hope, content
About the volume's true content,
Habit brought her quiet content,
But was dear Yevgeny content
But of those, good friends, insistent,
The pineapple's pure golden unguent.
Checked the sun, his watch - and went!
Then sips the news from some vile font,
He swims that little Hellespont,
The call of fame, praise, I forgot,
Like the fool I am, I clean forgot!
Adorns the table, boiling hot,
Lived you to the full, in riot,
Cosmopolitan, patriot,
You don't care for them a lot?
My country: exile was my lot,
He's here, my friend, Monsieur Guillot.
Even the fashion page, could not
For all of that now, have we not?
'Shall we begin?' 'Begin, why not?
A vital force flows from the root,
Vapour wreathes the china pot.
De Sta�l, Bichat, and Tissot;
There were some favourites he kept;
And with a smile, and an abrupt
Enter the Prince, to interrupt
Blessed with skill, the Muses' art
The future by some magic art,
He'd scorned, for her lack of art,
Unripe powers, or fading art,
His glance now bold, with tender art,
Grants an indifferent crowd her art;
But scarcely comprehends their art,
God knows whom and what; your art,
Again the pain, again love's art!
Derzhavin he who tuned his art
Or because her love lacks art,
Some fragment of my precious art,
Guarding with unconscious art
The bitter record of the heart.
To speak the language of the heart;
For the passions of the heart;
My poor Lensky, from the heart,
How swift his letters from the heart!
To Lensky's young, receptive heart.
Singing, from your burning heart
Tries to calm her beating heart,
And sound in every Russian heart!
Follows the promptings of her heart?
The deepest secret of her heart,
Out all the content of her heart;
A thought took root in her heart,
While faster, stronger pounds her heart.
Burned in my dear Tanya's heart!
My verse may touch someone's heart,
Pressing his hand to his heart,
By Yevgeny not for his heart
Pale afternoon is here, my heart,
Your grief, would never move my heart,
My Tatyana, with all my heart.
Towards me, wake hope in my heart,
Stirs blood inside my weary heart,
Valued feelings, with empty heart.
Finding him sensible, yet smart.
Wailing aloud her tragic part,
Then so be it: in friendship part,
Was made for this very part.
Behind the mill, while there, apart,
Some he liked and placed apart,
Or make this painful dream depart
But madden me, spur me to depart.
It would be painful to depart
Forgive me: I've loved from the start
Instead of bristling from the start,
Not pain, but death. So, at the start,
She gazes - feels a throbbing start,
So a seed begins to start
Distant hopes will sometimes start:
Live in that name, what echoes start,
Vladimir replies. They start
She falls to the snow, the bear alert
His sharp claws, she lies inert,
Manzoni, Herder, and Chamfort,
At times be silent, then in sport
By some careless lad for sport,
That serious and heartless sport,
Make a blunt or sharp retort,
Make him a favourite at Court?
Her to the wide deserted court:
Besides' - he thought - 'the die is cast,
An awkward guest at such a feast,
The noise, the tempests, and the feast,
And to the revels and the feast,
Blessed is he, who leaves the feast,
For all your gifts, even the least,
Not one to savour it in the least,
From the roof, face, shoulders, breast.
Virginal hope within her breast,
Make an escape, shield his breast
Russian pancakes, and they'd fast
Poor Tanya's youth fading fast:
And all the dreams the heart holds fast.
Fresh dreams will replace the last,
Onegin's tongue-tied to the last,
I travel another road, at last,
A gateway in a lane: at last!
Found another, served at last,
Had she found the word at last?
And my Eugene was free at last,
Wore the funeral crown at last.
Can it be true, that crown at last
Is now quite withered by the blast?
As, after winter's icy blast,
Yet (as all rules exceptions boast)
To separate blancmange from roast,
A Tsimlyansky, for a toast;
Two hours at least, but then, once past,
This fever born of youth once past,
In the high style of the past,
Freed from the burdens of the past.
Recalling romance of time past,
'But now, too late: the moment's past...
Traditions of the ages past,
Sang Russia's glorious ages past,
The guests have come, the hour is past,
Health, life's beauty, sweetness past,
Our brightest hopes, and the best,
Believe all things are for the best:
A walk indeed would suit me best,
The bullet shattering his chest.
Oh, I've no strength...it's my chest...
A glimpse of life, or a jest,
By slight of hand, or by some jest,
(Like love's young dream, another jest)
Because she's trusting, and honest
On that very couch, and rest;
I thought that freedom and rest
Snout, snow, storm, warlock, and the rest.
Before I meditate the rest.
Sed alia tempora! With the rest,
Parading there with all the rest,
Our dreams, those dearer than the rest,
Did full justice to the rest,
By affectation - not the rest.
We both should take a little rest...
His sad heart prevents all rest,
Till in the grave we shall rest...
Her aching heart can find no rest.
Sinks to rest...
Then, till Morpheus brought her rest,
All glad at heart to take their rest,
Strange his languor, there, at rest;
His soul's at peace, his bones at rest:
Or perhaps a pleasant rest,
Bear, bridge, darkness, fir and forest
Then rooms are found for every guest,
Sip coffee; or at his request
For trousers, dress-coat, or for vest;
Voice, manner, slender waist,
And glasses, tall, with narrow waist,
Changed places: there, you have the gist,
So, for an evening game of whist,
Eight times our heroes at their whist
Then settle like the evening mist...
His pleasure merely to assist:
Or, as if they'd ceased to exist,
Eugene more tolerant than most,
And never asked her husband first.
To suffer passion's parching thirst,
By the will of Zeus the Just.
While pointing out my famous bust.
He'd no desire to dig the dust
As his horses plough the dust,
Who keep my pyramid from rust,
Of history all turned to rust,
Virgil, Byron, Walter Scott,
There's Dominique de Pradt, or Scott.
While Hussars, on leave, have but
Inns, there are none. In some hut,
With that her weary voice gave out;
Till the flame is dying out;
And bony finger, point her out;
'Mine', Yevgeny's voice rings out,
And, in vain tedium, I play out
She wept, endured a coughing bout.
With many a solemn vow round about,
For you, still drag myself about,
He laughs - and they all fall about,
Prone to lead a fool about,
I'm not known; he's not about...
At forty suffer from the gout,
Alone together, at his shout.
In secret, or with raucous shout;
He nods - and there's a mighty shout;
Of horn and hoof and crooked snout,
Eat, drink, yawn; ill, and stout,
Freezing cold, a menu's put
Here acknowledged dandies strut
Paid tribute with a tear. 'Who's next?
Petushkov next, the local beau;
Browsed through Gibbon and Rousseau,
In Richardson or in Rousseau.
Farewell nature, my joy, adieu;
I've bowed to classicism: you,
Last year was it? I dandled you!
Fine...They're all well, and send you
Is it not true? I often heard you:
My goddesses! Where? Where are you?
While such dreams pursue you,
I freeze - my God! - to think of you,
Pay attention now I beg you,
By afternoon, of seeing you,
Olga and her mother ask you,
Though seeing the tenderness in you,
As, my Onegin, I do you.
Whom did your dream reveal to you?'
Though he is unknown to you,
I'll leave the verdict up to you.'
May Heaven's lightning wither you!
Indifferent to me or you,
Habit would cool my love for you.
What we sing's not meant for you!
And you my constant care, yes you
Dimitriev
Griboyedov
Snore for snore, fat Pustyakov,
Gvozdin, Buyanov, Petushkov,
And the ex-councillor Flyanov,
Then my 'cousin', Buyanov,
Fang and tusk and blood-stained jaw,
And far niente is my law.
Must go, a slave to army law.
He offers her a long curved claw,
Beard, tufted tail, sharp gleaming claw,
'Bring me ink and paper, draw
From here, plunged in thought, he saw
The Corsair or the Wandering Jew,
A lily in the morning dew,
The guileless stories, not a few
Bring fresh beauty to the view -
Of what the fashionable view,
At that time, and retired from view,
And hides it suddenly from view,
I suddenly beheld that view,
Thinking every place you view
Or Idol mio, till his review
Time dragged slowly or it flew,
Bowed to each acquaintance new,
How skilfully he'd feign the new,
For two days it was all quite new,
Are you as you were? Have new
As meek, as deaf, who, nothing new,
Where I'm told I'm nothing new,
That to us is nothing new.
Sped back towards the ball, anew.
Or slipper fuelled the flames anew.
Passion's tempests will renew,
My soul, nothing can renew....
The hours of anguished prayer I knew,
Tatyana was betrothed: some knew!
My foolish pupil now knew
Under her parent's gaze she grew
To each other, but liking grew,
Of all that sentimental stew
Noise, laughter, curtsey, bow,
And ask your Muse to take a bow,
Through this wide world. We bow,
My Moscow chose not to bow;
Is forced to curtsey to his bow.
Silent, leaning on an elbow,
How can we not love our Moscow?
The solitariness of the meadow,
On the misted glass, a shadow,
Mother scolds him from the window.
Tatyana hovers at the window,
His housekeeper, gazed out the window,
'The one who sat by the window,
While others sneered at the show,
No lady's ever deigned to show
Her voice tender, sweet and low,
Poor Lensky's reeling from the blow.
And all the world lies still, below,
Heels pounding on the wood below,
Tanya sleeps, at peace below.
And all this world dark below?
Over the simple urn below,
Towards the valley down below;
He sees a youth there, far below,
Down to the flooded fields below.
Stars the frozen shores below.
Their thirst, clink pitchers in the flow;
All serious effort - no words flow,
Bank and brake, sweet waters flow -
No madrigals from Lensky flow
Bathed in the moon's enchanted glow.
Pink softness of its sunset glow.
One window yields a rosy glow,
From the whispering tongues, allow,
He knew enough I would allow
Moved our hero, I'll allow,
As soon as daybreak will allow,
'Peasants there in riches wallow,
In that room, where the aged fellow
A mirror underneath the pillow,
Albion's proud lyre I follow,
The paths of humble prose I'll follow
Oh you, esteemed husbands, now
From the avenging bullet; now,
To cheers, applause. Tanya now
Only the shepherd, aged now,
The altar-fire's extinguished now.
Unnoticed, Tanya seated now,
Why must you pursue me now?
Baratynsky, were you with me now,
O Muse, receive your blessing now;
My life was but a pledge till now
No gift, no feast she gave him now,
Your poor Tanya, even now,
All this is out of fashion now,
Latin's not in fashion now,
Soaring up the marble stair now,
I must abandon him for now.
And yet, I am another's now,
Was she the one who but now
Onegin's love for books, we know,
Where Tanya met him, as we know.
What's to be done? As we all know,
To listen to you, and to know
The rage and spite she cannot know,
Were you in love? I must know!'
To our neighbour... he, you know,
Enough, it's all the same, you know,
As for Lensky's fate, you know,
Not? Besides I'd have you know,
From the neighbouring hills, the snow
A rainbow glitter on the snow.
Winter stalled its fall of snow
Crunching over morning snow.
Asleep it seems on melting snow,
Trees crowd round; it's drowned in snow,
The gleaming radiance on snow,
Glittering, the first winter snow
Covered by the powdery snow;
From two to thirty, in a row;
That bitter anger, that cold brow;
And that inscription on their brow,
Revealed that calm, indifferent brow?
Where two shadowy pine trees grow,
The twin lights of the carriage throw
Past the doorman like an arrow,
Ready to serve, today, tomorrow,
Looked for a divorce tomorrow,
'And he...but we've time tomorrow
I've learnt the sadness of tomorrow,
Forced to forgo that sweet tomorrow,
As though she had a private sorrow'
In misfortune, and in sorrow,
Wept violently in her sorrow,
And I lament my former sorrow.
Another's joy, another's sorrow,
Live in glory...ah, but sorrow
Friends, for the poet now you sorrow,
The babbling brook, the silent furrow,
With a large general in tow.
To keep well clear of them, I vow,
My services to you I vow!
And will be faithful to my vow.'
God sent you to me, I avow,
Chapter Six
Without an aim on which to fix,
Reaching the age of twenty-six,
Here's to my dear friend, Bordeaux!
Talk of Bentham and of Say,
Eccentric, eloquent, at bay!
And creditors had him at bay,
Blown by the wind, in swift decay.
Many a night, and many a day?
Alas! Her friend of many a day,
That occupied each night and day,
The long-delayed departure day
She loved to greet the break of day,
Reviving it the following day:
That sitting by the bed all day,
But never a fresh thought all day,
From Romulus to our own day,
As she might on any other day.
'It's time to rise my child; it's day:
Looks out, noting it is day,
There Didelot too crowned his day,
'Shall I live to see that day?'
All went smoothly from that day,
Longing to journey, day by day,
They rode together every day,
'I must?' - 'Yes: for Tanya's birthday.
He'd sit here of a Sunday,
'He promised he'd come, today,
So our heedless race today
I know it's in your power today
Tomorrow just like yesterday.
Of levied serfs, bathed Saturday,
To join them, it's next Saturday,
Perhaps the mail's caused some delay,'
She'd never argue: Let's delay
'Let's go.' They leave without delay,
Say farewell without delay.
Martin Zedeka can't allay,
To delight in childish play,
Olga's little friends to play,
Yet had compassion a part to play
Where on blue ice-floes light-beams play,
Not for the first time, made display
Yet none of it, the whole display
Sight of her sweet rural display.
With his offspring on display)
Though it's true some woman may
We'll move the mountains, and pay
Lights the mind with its bright ray,
By that window: now I pray
Congratulate ourselves. Hurray!
He enters...ah, what news, hurray,
Three notes appear, on a tray.
Bringing breakfast on a tray,
Though he'd no wish to betray
Her nightmare seeming to portray,
Lest from the chosen path I stray.
Like autumn leaves, that fall and stray,
Monotonous and varied, say,
With children of all ages, say
At tag in the meadows, say,
Even now I hear him say,
Though why it is, who can say,
From his uncle's man, to say
Of whom the age is bound to say:
'I write - what more is there to say?
About time too! (I hear you say?)
You're unsociable, they say
(The Romantic style, or so they say,
(Mechanically, as they say)
Reader, you'd know what they say?
'Of course not darling, only say...'
Not needing to prolong his stay,
Increase love's value, find a way
We too, we too, the same old way;
In the same lively, carefree way
With your staff point out the way,
Mention Juvenal by the way,
In it: no matter, that's by the way).
Rousseau (I mention it by the way)
To running things the modern way;
Steps delicately on her way;
Her father, mother, not her way
Thrilled him in its former way,
And slowly they both made their way
The band will come: they're on their way,
Would Hymen strew along our way,
Humbly, with him, on life's way.
Our friend behaved well, in his way,
And high time to be on his way.
Now anxious to be on his way,
Let her pursue her own sweet way,
Are treated in the kindest way
Homeward they go the shortest way,
And we....don't shine in any way,
And stride in arches every way,
Unifying every by-way.
In his memory tucked away.
Eyes misted, as they sped away...
The sledded coaches, stored away,
Then his father passed away,
Simply to pass the time away
Frightening a timid love away
Then carry the dread thing away.
The ladies seated; then away:
And kept dull boredom far away -
Rise from the shore, and soar away.
As the stars' choir fades away,
His beaver-collar shines away,
Turns, page in hand then sings away
All night, barely a foot away!
Russia will be one great highway,
X was a fine man, anyway.
'Goodness how the years speed by!'
For all those years long sped by?
Dowagers smiled as she passed by;
Happy the one who has passed by,
And, if permitted, by and by,
Then supper, bedtime, by and by,
Then to the altar, by and by....
To supply the details, by and by.
To all unfaithful by and by,
(As was the case in times gone by,
Like fence-posts swiftly flashing by.
The light-footed girls sweep by,
The crunch of snow...someone goes by;
Of its arrow, or death wings by,
A brief snow-flurry spirals by,
Sipping the hour as it slips by;
Couples sweeping wildly by;
Doze on the fur coats in the lobby,
Pursue love wholly, and thereby
The horses to the oak nearby.
More deeply in his lunacy,
Penned with unerring accuracy,
The object of his constancy;
Liked his dreamy tendency,
Her word away, she's pledged already
Ah, now but you're up already!
They've taken four steps already,
'Now, approach!' Calm and steady,
When a fashionable lady
And choke him with a tragedy,
Produced his hive of comedy,
A stoneware jug of cider handy,
In another home-made brandy,
With a familiar melody:
A lexicon, a parody?
But now our minds are somewhat cloudy,
Were all their constant study.
Even in books, virtue's dowdy,
No suspicions... nurse, obey.' -
Until, such good friends were they
Startling the wild ducks till they
'Where's Anisya with the key?'
Through meadows, down a lime-tree alley,
Deep in the hill-encircled valley,
On my long and silent journey;
The Skotinins, turning grey,
Or worse still, freeze and petrify,
Where we can...' 'Oh, an elegy!
Rhymes her, in an elegy.
Our stomachs - prompt horology.
I love youth's frantic energy,
No reason why a man of energy
Turned, and saw before her: 'Why,
At least a pretence of empathy,
But we've so many neighbours, why
Of how it lives, the what and why
And when a meteor crossed the sky,
The moon, a lamp in the sky,
A brilliant azure lights the sky,
Roam beneath my African sky,
Rushes to live, and makes haste to feel. Prince Vyazemsky
Leaning on the dam-wall, Lensky,
Toasting his fair neighbour, Lensky,
'And here with our neighbour, Lensky,
Returning to his home, young Lensky
While Onegin turns to Lensky:
Glancing round to seek her Lensky,
By Olga and her lover Lensky.
Flushed and satisfied. Poor Lensky
Eugene stares down at Lensky,
Baratynsky
While, quite the engineer, Zaretsky,
Zhukovsky
Let us part now amicably,
Treading the boards interminably,
At home receives him equably,
But who, in this select assembly,
But Tanya wrote it all so badly,
Although we welcome you, so gladly.
Richardson she loved quite madly,
Olga too yawns by him, sadly
Never read Russian papers, sadly,
That the country bores you, sadly;
Read it secretively, sadly,
- No, nobody, assuredly!
So the gullible would blindly,
While Zaretsky measures nicely,
Should be forgot...so, opportunely,
His expression quite sincerely,
And promise you, most sincerely,
Or shouts for his Moina, merely
He condemned himself severely:
- 'But why berate him so severely,
Guard your daughters most severely,
Tea, then: the girls take up, demurely,
That can't be a problem, surely
Thirty two paces, precisely.
Raise your lorgnettes, watch them closely,
I tore my heart away, completely
Surrendered himself completely.
Next they sit, and talk politely,
He leaves the ball, and pensively
Leaning, musing pensively,
Stated it quite positively,
Olga's turned into, so lovely,
Denizen of the wings, he'll fly
His prison, loyal, prepared to fly
The greater her attempts to fly,
As giddy youth, the dancers fly,
All is well: our moments fly,
From the yard the serf-boys fly,
Cock their pistols, and let fly,
As ardent glances swiftly fly
Or, less harshly, like a butterfly
Or played a part unwittingly;
Endeared himself more readily
Reaches the table, speedily,
Who'll be there? Just the family,
Some decent neighbouring family
A simple Russian family
'So I joined another family,
Delayed though, temporarily,
Poor Guillot stands, uneasily,
Eugene stood there uneasily,
Arrive, and greeted heartily,
Where days flowed by so lazily,
His eyes from you...there now, quickly,
Since it's late, and travel quickly:
Still bears a hope, a dream darkly.
All things declare, and magically,
Shakhovskoy, so sardonically,
Dealt with her sympathetically;
Greet her enthusiastically,
To read him, nor preferred really
In London sets especially,
To be condemned impartially,
Who's dropped by accidentally,
The storm is done, and cruelly,
His mind, incisive, and chilly;
Their visits an unwelcome folly,
I might commit a daring folly
Called by his neighbour, forcefully.
To burn - while reason forcefully
As wife and mother, faithfully.
When my head ached so painfully?
Or by Lethe blissfully
Finds her Ideal, and fitfully
He slept at last, but fitfully,
All their romance seen dimly
Takes aim now - when, suddenly,
He might have spoken openly,
Ate, drank, then left, solemnly
Repeating to it solemnly
And rightly so: For sitting sternly
As he lowers horns, stubbornly,
And scratch her neck, and stubbornly
My sweet child, as God is holy.'
Singer of Feasts and melancholy,
Lost in her deep melancholy,
Her pallor, and her melancholy,
He pens a swift, polite reply.
'Killed!'...And with that stark reply,
She scarcely breathed; made no reply;
The day slips past, with no reply,
Deaf, voiceless, never to reply,
The poet awaits Eugene's reply:
That, I'm denied; and, simply
With staple products its supply,
But not quite yet. Although I dearly
Yet her spouse loved her dearly,
Is it because we're given, clearly,
In order to be heard more clearly.
Trusted her himself, quite clearly,
Immersed his soul there, utterly:
She disregards him utterly,
And then, to part us utterly...
Speak of him, and endlessly
Calls out his name...uselessly:
Castigated ruthlessly
There she stands, helplessly.
Why quarrel with the age fruitlessly?
Immerse in, so relentlessly!
Their harness chafing, restlessly,
Zaretsky bites his lip, crossly,
All objects spoke mysteriously,
Against intruders; furiously,
Trembled at omens, anxiously;
Foot it sweetly, now and neatly,
Her mother always valued greatly
His dreams disturb him sadly, sweetly,
When in the doorway, loudly, sweetly,
The accounts were done, and swiftly
The night's shadows thinning swiftly,
'Or did her sorrow vanish swiftly?
Refused - found consolation swiftly,
Perhaps I turned away too swiftly,
You're really going? And so swiftly?
Though precious time goes swiftly,
Tanya on her luck, but swiftly
While, herald of the morning, lightly
Nature wakes from dream, lightly,
For the waltz, and stepping lightly;
Yet, inclined to treat them lightly,
He valued such things little, rightly;
Greets the new season, brightly.
And the edge of earth grows brightly,
Still clutching his pistol, tightly,
Or else, reviewing distantly,
It brought to life, instantly,
Tatyana asks: And instantly
You appeared, and instantly,
Her tears falling constantly.
While disillusion dogged him constantly,
To dream affection constantly
What mother preaches constantly.
No, to be with you constantly;
Then gaze at Tanya, silently,
Reading a letter, silently,
Hoarding her treasure silently,
Is he, who lingers silently,
Enters the study silently,
Blows and howls - and presently,
Though I've consulted frequently
In the past quite frequently
Ingenuous, trusting, earnestly
Love's madness, wild and unruly,
No one, my friends, I tell you, truly!
At his neighbour's grave, and truly
Then, across the fields, slowly,
By both friend and enemy,
To infuriate your enemy,
The smart coquettes' smart enemy,
As a recluse, idle, gloomy,
On our northern snows, so gloomy,
Seem to pine, be sad or gloomy,
I was bitter, he was gloomy.
But as for genius, if any,
Her description here from any
(Critics stern, acute as any)
Onegin, he was deemed by many
And when I fled that company,
He'd called, was pleasant company;
In that rural wilderness, Yevgeny
Swiftly apprising Yevgeny
As Muraviev, our Yevgeny.
But he's in error; our Yevgeny
		    'Here's Yevgeny!
'My second?' - echoes Yevgeny:
A second Chadayev, my Yevgeny,
The wealth of things my Yevgeny
Of life itself and destiny,
Where, held in the hands of destiny,
Mine another destiny....
So near! ...But now my destiny
With what strange languid agony,
No villain's hidden agony,
Habit soothed her agony,
Her heart still, in it's agony,
But if you knew this agony:
If he had known what agony
Plain, devoid of ceremony.
When I was but a little boy,
Tanya, like a lovesick boy;
Days and nights an anguished joy.
Sleeps peacefully in blissful joy
I suffered without hope or joy.
That all last winter gave you joy;
How proud the glance you'll employ!
Happy is he who can employ
In foreign gig that you employ,
I foresee all: how I'll annoy
Took his old medal for a toy!
'Ah, Nurse, Nurse, I'm so unhappy,
Three bottles a day, for him, chez V�ry.
Beyond the voiceless boundary,
Of mortgaging his land quite weary.
My incorrigible, never weary,
The Academic Dictionary.
The dullards we deem necessary;
A fashionable glossary,
In dreams, that fevered, solitary,
That dressing room, all solitary,
Await the touch, involuntary,
Onegin shudders, turns, gives a cry
More pleasant still, if he should cry,
'Clear the road!' loud sings the cry,
To your heartfelt, despairing cry?
To the old dears' perennial cry:
But swiftly, at her nervous cry,
Listen for the heart's first cry,
Let it not wither, harsh and dry,
The wafer meant to seal it's dry,
Waves her mantle, somewhat tawdry,
Once cold-blooded lechery
Was praised, all that debauchery
Or intellect prompts mockery;
To all my plaintive misery.
Survey provincial mystery;
Is troubled by its mystery.
That sad and dangerous mystery,
And life a transient mystery:
That's veiled in deepest mystery.
No rhetoric, no flattery,
And know the answer to my query:
Until a fresh discovery
Left his father, stunned by theory,
Proud witness of that fallen glory,
A Petersburg ball, in all its glory,
Bitten by the snake, Memory,
That one line in the memory
Lethe will drown all memory
Eugene, do you see in memory
Her face possessed his memory,
My soul preserved its memory
Tanya, it's gone, my memory,
Nurse, I'm bored, tell me a story.'
Drive on! And, to resume our story,
How often, with some secret story
At the commencement of my story
But on, on with my story!
A cure for my sad history,
I can't count them if I try.'
All in good time, trust me, I'll try
Of over-elaborate slander try
Filled with terror, see her try
You, gleams of sacred poetry?
Almost embraced pure poetry -
Bits of Northern poetry
Of your sublime clear poetry.
To give his life for poetry,
Self, and end my poetry.
No affected coquetry....
Betrays no trace of coquetry,
The pleasures of the local gentry
Goes to raid nature's treasury.
Pampered in eastern luxury
Of the sacred flames of poesy,
For boredom, and hypocrisy,
Before, to prompt her minstrelsy,
Stares, grows mad with jealousy;
Conceal his hopes, feign jealousy,
Then calmly stir his jealousy,
The crush, the lights, the gaiety,
St Petersburg's high society,
So frowned on in society.
In the eyes of our society?'
Once more rejects society,
Exhausted by society,
Would give you notoriety,
Ingenuous naivety,
And far away from our great city,
Wishes, good health, felicity,
Only serene simplicity.
Your spirit's true simplicity
The charms of sweet simplicity.
Faced with her sweet simplicity,
His unique eccentricity,
Of placid dull rusticity
A melancholy oddity,
And learned life's bland reality:
Concealing its reality.
With old-fashioned hospitality.
With copious hospitality.
His uncle's frail mortality.
Then prove his own mortality,
The ode shows pure nobility
Moments of grave sublimity,
My world with equanimity,
Hope and love and enmity,
Perhaps this is all vanity,
Her smile, her calm serenity,
A few steps from eternity,
The Muse gave it eternity,
Dear Lord, enough, enough! Have pity!
Faced with her soul's bright clarity! ...
That only mediocrity
So he'll double the intensity
A satanic monstrosity,
By self-satisfied nonentity;
And in deep perplexity,
Awakes a young man's loyalty,
His knowledge of her frailty?
Why then consider Tanya guilty?
Now, I'm in some difficulty,
Achieving peace at last, and plenty;
Him hope, deploy uncertainty,
So thin, and sparse, and so empty,
His fervent dreams of liberty,
Their greetings, ah, what a beauty
Distanced from the claims of beauty,
Written by my pure young beauty,
Hour by hour, by Olga's beauty
Pleased that they had done their duty.
I gave my word, and it's my duty,
Fearing all the barbs of envy,
